    "002.Laysan_Albatross": "Laysan Albatrosses are very large seabirds (though they are among the smaller albatrosses). They have very long, very narrow wings. The neck is thick and the head is large. Slightly smaller, more slender, and narrower-winged than a Brown Pelican; much larger than a Western Gull. Both Sexes. Length: 31.1-31.9 in (79-81 cm). Weight: 77.6-151.7 oz (2200-4300 g). Wingspan: 76.8-79.9 in (195-203 cm). goose-sized or larger. Laysan Albatrosses are white-headed birds with dark gray-brown upperwings and mostly white underwings (with variable dark markings). The underparts are clean white. They have a dark patch around the eye. In flight, note the dark back, white rump, and dark tail. They fly by dynamic soaring: gliding low over the waves and then wheeling up into the sky to take advantage of the wind. They rarely flap their wings. They feed by sitting on the water, often at night, catching squid and other small prey with their bills. Laysan Albatrosses spend most of their time on the open Pacific Ocean, spanning tropical waters up to the southern Bering Sea. They nest on open, sandy or grassy islands, mostly in the Hawaiian Island chain.  One of the most captivating features of this albatross is its magnificent bill, which is large, strong, and pinkish-yellow in color. The bill, which protrudes from the bird's face, is long and hooked, ideal for capturing prey during its foraging expeditions over the vast ocean. This striking bill, prominently showcased in bird photographs, provides an essential tool for the Laysan Albatross to secure its food sources, which mainly consist of fish and squid.",

Average adult body mass is about 2.5 kg (5.5 lbs), with males weighing more than females. Plumage ranges from a sooty-brown to a sooty-black color depending on the individual, but the head and sometimes tail are typically darker than the rest of the body. Around almost the entire eye, excluding the inner corner, a white ring is present. On the lower jaw, a yellow to orange line is present on the beak, which is otherwise a uniform glossy black. Juvenile or immature sooty albatrosses look nearly identical after losing their down feathers. A beautiful smoky-brown albatross with bright white eye crescents and an orange line running down the bill that gives this otherwise regal bird a goofy appearance. Unlike the otherwise similar Light-mantled Albatross, the present species\u2019 dark head does not contrast with the rest of the body. Also note Light-mantled\u2019s less obvious blue-gray bill line. Dark morph giant-petrels can be similar at a glance, but have larger, bulbous pink bills, and average more long-necked and hunch-backed in appearance. A pelagic species, ranging throughout much of the southern Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Nests on a handful of islands in that region, favoring areas with steep rocky slopes and tussock grass. ",
    "005.Crested_Auklet": "Crested Auklet. Dumpy, dark alcid with pale eyes; very small, only slightly larger than a sparrow. Note the thin white \u201cwhiskers\u201d trailing backwards from behind each eye. Breeding birds are dark gray-black overall, with a droopy forward-arching crest and a bright orange bill with an uptilted gape which gives them a maniacally grinning appearance. Non-breeding adults and immatures are duller, with a smaller, darker bill and the barest hints of a crest. Breeds in immense colonies on remote rocky islands and forages out at sea. Very vocal at colonies, but also gives occasional yapping barks when out foraging in groups. The crested auklet can measure 18\u201327 cm (7.1\u201310.6 in) in length, 34\u201350 cm (13\u201320 in) in wingspan and weigh 195\u2013330 g (6.9\u201311.6 oz). They have a reddish-orange and yellow tipped bill, yellowish white irises, and white auricular plumes from their eyes to their ears. Their bodies, wings, and tails are primarily dark sooty grey, while their legs and feet are grey and claws black. The males and females are very similar, although the females have slightly smaller and less curved bills, additionally slightly smaller crests. Crested auklets are known for their forehead crests, which is made of black forward-curving feathers. These forehead crests are highly variable, and can have between two and twenty three narrow forward curving feathers. The average auklet has 12 crest feathers, which are of variable length, between 8.1 and 58.5 millimetres. Auklets have auricular plumes and a bright orange bill with curved accessory plates. Like forehead crests, these features vary widely within auklet populations. The crested auklet is recognized primarily by two characteristics during the breeding season. The first is its crest, a group of bristle feathers located on top of its head above its eyes. The second is a social odor that the auklets produce during the breeding season, described as smelling like tangerines. This odor originates from tiny wick feathers, located in a small patch of skin between the shoulder blades. In winter plumage, their bills are smaller and dull yellow. They lack accessory plates and their crest and auricular plumes are reduced. Juveniles are similar to winter adults, but without auricular and crest plumes. Their bills are smaller, and colored a dull brownish yellow. ",

Females and nonbreeding males are warm buffy brown, streaked with dark brown on the back and flanks. They have bold brown stripes on the crown but are unstreaked on the nape of the neck. The bill is pinkish. In spring, male Bobolinks give conspicuous display flights low over grasslands, fluttering their wings while singing. At other times, Bobolinks stay hidden in tall grasses or brush, clinging to seed heads or foraging on the ground amid the stems. They often migrate in large flocks. Bobolinks are birds of tall grasslands, uncut pastures, overgrown fields and meadows, and the continent\u2019s remaining prairies. While molting and on migration, look for them in marshes and in agricultural fields, particularly rice fields.  In its breeding plumage, the male Bobolink features a striking blend of colors. From a distance, its upperparts appear predominantly black, contrasting with a vibrant yellow nape and the back of the neck. The white crest atop its head further accentuates its distinctive appearance. As we observe more closely, we notice subtle white patches on its wings, which stand out against the black feathers, creating an intriguing contrast.

Females and immatures are a uniform, bright yellow-green overall, with a pale eyering. Though they are basically unpatterned, their overall color is greener and brighter than similar songbirds. Painted Buntings forage on the ground in dense cover, among grasses, or at seed feeders. Sometimes they venture out into grass to forage on seeds. On migration they form loose flocks with other seed-eating birds. Breeding males often perch out in the open to sing their jumbled, sweet songs. Painted Buntings breed in dense brush, often adjacent to thick, grassy areas or woodland edges. During migration and winter they favor dense, weedy habitats as well as the understory of semi-open forest. One of the most remarkable features of the Painted Bunting is its striking sexual dimorphism. Males and females differ greatly in appearance, with the males exhibiting an exquisitely vibrant color palette while the females adorn more subdued tones. The male Painted Bunting sports a combination of bright blue head and upper body, interspersed with contrasting splashes of red on the lower back and rump. The wings and tail feathers are a blend of green and yellow, which further accentuate its captivating appearance. In contrast, the female Painted Bunting possesses a olive-green plumage on the upper body, which gradually fades into a pale yellowish hue on the belly. This sexual dichotomy allows for easy identification and differentiation between the male and female members of this species. ",

Their coloring differs from other bowerbirds which have a plumage color pattern consisting of a mixture of two colors of various proportions. The cryptic plumage coloring of the catbird aids in parental care by helping the catbird blend into its surroundings allowing males and females to tend to the nestlings. It may also allow spotted catbirds to spend more time foraging as they blend into the surrounding foliage. Their voice is described as loud with cat-like wailing. They produce a nasal here-I-arr call with sharp clicks and three loud cries. They can be heard calling all times of the day especially at dawn and dusk and call more frequently on during cooler temperatures with dewy mornings and after rain. ",

Catbirds are secretive but energetic, hopping and fluttering from branch to branch through tangles of vegetation. Singing males sit atop shrubs and small trees. Catbirds are reluctant to fly across open areas, preferring quick, low flights over vegetation. Look for Gray Catbirds in dense tangles of shrubs, small trees, and vines, along forest edges, streamside thickets, old fields, and fencerows.  The Gray Catbird is approximately 8-9 inches (20-23 cm) long, slightly larger than a sparrow. Its most prominent feature is its uniform gray plumage, which covers its entire body, including the wings and the long, elegant tail. The feathers on its chest and belly have a slightly lighter shade of gray, while the back and upper wings appear slightly darker. This monochrome coloration contributes to its overall subtle and understated appearance. One of the most remarkable visual characteristics of the Gray Catbird is its distinctive black cap on the top of its head.

Shiny Cowbirds forage in flocks, often with other blackbird species. They feed mostly on the ground, searching for seeds, grains, and insects. Males sing a gurgling song and display to females in the air, from a tree, or on the ground. Forages in many open and semiopen habitats, from parks and gardens, roadsides, and farm fields to the edges of riparian woodlands and mangrove forests. Ornithologists recognize at least seven subspecies in the Caribbean and South America, all rather similar to one another. Only the smallest subspecies, minimus, is known in the United States.  In terms of physical appearance, the Shiny Cowbird stands out with its distinct features. On average, it measures around 20 centimeters in length and has a wingspan of approximately 34 centimeters. The overall body shape is rather robust, with a short tail and a stocky build. The bird's plumage is glossy black, which explains its name \u2013 \"shiny.\" This dark hue extends throughout its body, including its head, neck, upperparts, and underparts. Unlike many other birds, the Shiny Cowbird lacks striking patterns or vibrant colors, relying instead on its sleek and shimmering jet-black appearance. One of the defining traits of the Shiny Cowbird is its bright-red eye. This vibrant eye color contrasts sharply against the bird's black features, drawing attention and giving it a striking allure. Additionally, its beak is short and conical, perfectly adapted for its feeding habits.",
    "028.Brown_Creeper": "Brown Creepers are tiny yet lanky songbirds. They have long, spine-tipped tails, slim bodies, and slender, decurved bills. Smaller than a White-breasted Nuthatch; larger than a Golden-crowned Kinglet. sparrow-sized or smaller. Both Sexes. Length: 4.7-5.5 in (12-14 cm). Weight: 0.2-0.3 oz (5-10 g). Wingspan: 6.7-7.9 in (17-20 cm). Streaked brown and buff above, with their white underparts usually hidden against a tree trunk, Brown Creepers blend easily into bark. Their brownish heads show a broad, buffy stripe over the eye (supercilium). Brown Creepers search for small insects and spiders by hitching upward in a spiral around tree trunks and limbs. They move with short, jerky motions using their stiff tails for support. To move to a new tree, they fly weakly to its base and resume climbing up. Brown Creepers sing a high, warbling song; they also give a high, wavering call note that sounds similar to that of a Golden-crowned Kinglet. Brown Creepers breed primarily in mature evergreen or mixed evergreen-deciduous forests. You can find them at many elevations, even as high as 11,000 feet at treeline in the West. In the winter season, the species moves into a broader variety of forests and becomes much easier to find in deciduous woodlands. Brown Creepers vary somewhat in color and voice across their range. The most noticeable is the \u201cMexican\u201d Brown Creeper, which ranges into southeastern Arizona and New Mexico. It tends to be darker on the back than creepers in other parts of North America.

    "030.Fish_Crow": "Fish Crows fit the standard crow shape: hefty, well-proportioned birds with heavy bills, sturdy legs, and broad wings. At rest, Fish Crows\u2019 wings fall short of their medium-length, square tails. Very slightly smaller than an American Crow. crow-sized. Both Sexes. Length: 14.2-15.8 in (36-40 cm). Weight: 6.9-11.6 oz (195-330 g). Wingspan: 33.1 in (84 cm). Fish Crows are all black. Immatures are less glossy and can become brownish as their feathers wear in their first year. Fish Crows are very social birds\u2014look for them in pairs in the breeding season and up to several hundred or more during migration or winter. When feeding and roosting they may mix with American Crows. When Fish Crows give their distinctive nasal calls from the ground, they often puff out their neck and body feathers, forming a distinctive, ragged ruff on the throat. Fish Crows live along the coasts and inland along major freshwater rivers and lakes. You may find Fish Crows in a wide variety of habitats near water, often in towns and cities near parks, docks, and landfills. They share many habitats with American Crows.  The Fish Crow's head is rounded, with a slightly curved bill that ends in a sharp point, ideal for scavenging and poking at its prey. Its eyes are dark brown, almost black, providing excellent vision for locating food both on land and in water. The legs and feet are black and robust, adapted for perching on trees as well as walking and hopping along shorelines.",
    "032.Mangrove_Cuckoo": "A large, lanky bird with a long tail, long, full wings, and a fairly thick, curved bill. Larger than a Northern Mockingbird, smaller than a Common Grackle. between robin and crow. Both Sexes. Brown above, buffy below, especially on the belly, with a dark mask, yellow or gray eyering, and bold black-and-white pattern on the underside of the tail. The bill is mostly black, with the lower (basal) portion yellow. Perches in tree canopies and watches carefully for insects, lizards, and other prey, then hops or flies quickly at prey once spotted. \u201cTenderizes\u201d larger prey by beating it against a branch. Often sits motionless for long periods. Red mangrove and black mangrove stands in Florida, as well as in hardwood hammocks and beach scrub, usually near mangroves. In Caribbean and Latin America, look for them in scrubby woodlands, cultivated areas, rainforest, and cloud forest.  In terms of size, the Mangrove Cuckoo measures approximately 10 to 12 inches (25-30 cm) in length, making it a medium-sized cuckoo. Its slender and elongated body shape, including a long tail, gives it a sleek and graceful appearance. The cuckoo's overall coloration is predominantly a rich chestnut brown, accompanied by a noticeable blackish mask around its eyes, contrasting sharply with its pale yellow throat and belly. This color pattern helps it blend into the dappled sunlight filtering through the dense foliage of its mangrove habitat. Its wings, which are broad and rounded, display a beautiful contrast of colors. They exhibit a dark brown coloration on the upper side, while their undersides are more rufous or reddish-brown. This creates a striking visual effect when the bird takes flight, as its wings momentarily reveal these vibrant hues. Additionally, the cuckoo's primary feathers display white spots or streaks, which can be observed when their wings are spread or during courtship displays.",
    "039.Least_Flycatcher": "Least Flycatchers are the smallest Empidonax flycatcher in the East. Like other flycatchers they tend to perch upright, but they appear a little more compact than most. The primary feathers on their wings are short, which makes their thin tail look longer. Their head is round and is not peaked at the back of the head like some other Empidonax. Larger than a Blue-gray Gnatcatcher, smaller than an Eastern Wood-Pewee. sparrow-sized or smaller. Both Sexes. Length: 4.7-5.5 in (12-14 cm). Weight: 0.3-0.5 oz (8-13 g). Wingspan: 7.9 in (20 cm) Least Flycatchers are grayish olive above with a dusky breast. Their head is grayish olive as well with a bold white eyering. They have a very faint yellow wash to the belly and 2 white wingbars. Least Flycatchers congregate in clusters in deciduous forests during the breeding season. They sing incessantly throughout the summer, tossing their head back with each chebec. They tend to flit from perch to perch among dead branches in the middle to upper level of the forest canopy. Least Flycatchers breed in deciduous and mixed forests of all ages including second-growth and mature forests. These forests tend to have a few shrubs or small saplings in the understory and a well-developed canopy.  One of the key visual distinctions of the Least Flycatcher lies in its prominent eyering. This characteristic eyering encircles its eye, creating a striking contrast against the rest of its face. The eyering is typically pale, often white or pale gray in color. It accentuates the bird's dark eyes, giving it an alert and attentive expression. This feature aids birdwatchers in recognizing the Least Flycatcher more easily amidst other similar-looking flycatcher species.",
    "040.Olive_sided_Flycatcher": "A stocky, barrel-chested flycatcher, with a large head and a heavy, long bill for its size. It has rather long wings that can make the tail look short. Larger than a Western Wood-Pewee, smaller than a Western Kingbird. between sparrow and robin. Both Sexes. Length: 7.1-7.9 in (18-20 cm). Weight: 1.0-1.4 oz (28-40.4 g). Wingspan: 12.4-13.6 in (31.5-34.5 cm). Sooty gray-brown above (with olive tones only in optimal light and fresh plumage), paler below. The dark gray sides of the breast contrast with white in the center, making it look as if the bird is wearing a vest. From the rear, large white tufts at the sides of the back are sometimes visible. Olive-sided Flycatchers spend much of their time perched high in trees, watching for large flying insects. They catch these insects by sallying\u2014flying out in quick pursuit, seizing the prey in its bill, and returning to the same perch. Breeds mostly in northern and montane coniferous forest from sea level to timberline and the edge of the tundra. They are most numerous in mid- and higher-elevation forest in mountains (3,000\u20137,000 feet elevation) and around burned or boggy areas with numerous openings and dead trees. Migrants and wintering birds also favor gaps in coniferous forest. A subspecies known as majorinus breeds in southern California and northern Baja California. These individuals have longer wings and tails than Olive-sided Flycatchers in the rest of the range. ",
    "041.Scissor_tailed_Flycatcher": "Scissor-tailed Flycatchers are slender, stout-billed kingbirds with very long, stiff, deeply forked tails. Males have longer tail feathers than females and immatures. Smaller and more slender overall than an American Robin, but can seem larger because of the very long tail; larger than an Eastern Phoebe. robin-sized. Both Sexes. These are pale gray birds with blackish wings and black tails with white edges. Adults have salmon-pink flanks that extend to underwing patches that are very conspicuous in flight. Males are more intensely colored than females. Scissor-tailed Flycatchers perch conspicuously on utility lines, treetops, and fence lines to watch for insect prey and defend their territories from interlopers. They are agile in the air, spreading their long tails wide to make abrupt turns and stalls. They are highly territorial, and will chase other birds out of their territories accompanied by loud, squeaky, bubbling calls. Scissor-tailed Flycatchers breed in open habitats in the southern Great Plains and south Texas, especially around scattered trees or utility lines. They tolerate human presence well and frequently breed in towns.  The Scissor-tailed Flycatcher is a medium-sized bird, measuring approximately 8-15 inches in length, with a noticeable forked tail that gives it its name. This striking feature sets it apart from other flycatchers and makes it instantly recognizable. The tail is elongated, comprising a central portion with two long, gracefully tapering, and symmetrical streamers on either side. The length of these streamers can vary, but they are usually longer in males, reaching up to 10-12 inches in some instances. The tail's forked design aids in mid-air agility and maneuverability, contributing to their prowess in catching flying insects. In terms of coloration, the Scissor-tailed Flycatcher exhibits a mesmerizing palette of hues. Most notably, it showcases a predominantly pale, light grayish body, which contrasts beautifully against its bold black wings and black crown. These black feathers at the top of the bird's head extend down to create an eye-line, providing an impressive visual element to its appearance. Its wings are broad and pointed, enabling swift and precise flight maneuvers.",
    "042.Vermilion_Flycatcher": "A fairly small, stocky flycatcher with an upright posture. Fairly flat headed and barrel chested, with a slender tail and a broad, straight bill. Larger than a Blue-gray Gnatcatcher, smaller than an Ash-throated Flycatcher. between sparrow and robin. Both Sexes. Adult males are brilliant orange-red with a dark brown mask through the eyes and brown back, wings, and tail. Females and immatures are gray-brown with faint streaks on the breast and a salmon-red blush on the underparts. The bill is black. Vermilion Flycatchers spend long periods sitting on exposed perches such as the tops of shrubs and fence lines. They watch for flying insects, catching them in midair by quick flights (sallies), and often returning to the same perch. Open, shrubby habitats including scrubby desert, lightly cultivated lands, and riverine woodlands, and shrubby tropical lowlands. There are no regional differences among Vermilion Flycatchers in the United States, but some populations in South America are entirely ashy gray-brown.  The Vermilion Flycatcher flaunts distinct physical characteristics that help differentiate it from other avian species. Measuring approximately 13-14 centimeters in length, it is relatively petite with a slim and elongated build. Its body shape is sleek, featuring a rounded head, a gracefully curved neck, and a moderately long tail. The bird's body is adorned with soft and sleek feathers, providing efficient insulation against varying climatic conditions. The defining feature of the Vermilion Flycatcher is, of course, its vivid plumage. The males don a brilliant red-orange hue, especially noticeable along their chest, belly, and sides. This vibrant red is contrasted by their dark brownish-gray back and wings, creating a striking visual effect. The males also feature distinct black markings on their faces, including a dark eye stripe and a black bill, while their eyes sparkle with a deep brown color. This coloration makes the Vermilion Flycatcher stand out remarkably against the backdrop of its preferred habitats.",
    "044.Frigatebird": "Frigatebirds are large slender mostly black-plumaged seabirds, with the five species similar in appearance to each other. The largest species is the magnificent frigatebird, which reaches 114 cm (45 in) in length, with three of the remaining four almost as large. The lesser frigatebird is substantially smaller, at around 71 cm (28 in) long. Frigatebirds exhibit marked sexual dimorphism; females are larger and up to 25 percent heavier than males, and generally have white markings on their underparts. Frigatebirds have short necks and long, slender hooked bills. Their long narrow wings (male wingspan can reach 2.3 metres (7.5 ft)) taper to points. Their wings have eleven primary flight feathers, with the tenth the longest and eleventh a vestigial feather only, and 23 secondaries. Their tails are deeply forked, though this is not apparent unless the tail is fanned. The tail and wings give them a distinctive 'W' silhouette in flight. The legs and face are fully feathered. The totipalmate feet are short and weak, the webbing is reduced and part of each toe is free. The bones of frigatebirds are markedly pneumatic, making them very light and contributing only 5% to total body weight. The pectoral girdle is strong as its bones are fused. The pectoral muscles are well-developed, and weigh as much as the frigatebird's feathers\u2014around half the body weight is made up equally of these muscles and feathers. The males have inflatable red-coloured throat pouches called gular pouches, which they inflate to attract females during the mating season. The gular sac is, perhaps, the most striking frigatebird feature. These can only deflate slowly, so males that are disturbed will fly off with pouches distended for some time. Frigatebirds remain in the air and do not settle on the ocean. They produce very little oil from their uropygial glands so their feathers would become sodden if they settled on the surface. In addition, with their long wings relative to body size, they would have great difficulty taking off again. ",
    "045.Northern_Fulmar": "Looks superficially like a gull. A heavyset, medium-sized seabird with a short neck, stout body, large head, and long wings. The bill is stout and hooked, with two nasal tubes on the top edge. Larger than a Ring-billed Gull, smaller than a Herring Gull. crow-sized. Both Sexes. Length: 15.3-19.7 in (39-50 cm). Weight: 15.9-35.3 oz (450-1000 g). Wingspan: 39.4-44.1 in (100-112 cm). Most fulmars are light morph: gray above and white below, a pattern similar to large gulls. Some dark morphs occur in the North Pacific and are pale to dark gray all over. Flies with very stiff, shallow wingbeats interspersed with glides, a style very different from gulls. Catches prey at the sea surface or makes shallow dives underwater. Often forages in large flocks, mixed with other seabird species and sometimes marine mammals. Nests in dense colonies on rocky islands and cliffs. Forages far offshore, where upwelling brings nutrients and fish toward the surface. Also collects around fishing vessels to scavenge discarded fish parts. Ornithologists recognize two or three subspecies, the small, short- and thick-billed glacialis of the Arctic Ocean, in which the darker morphs predominate; the large-billed auduboni of the Atlantic, in which there are no dark morphs; and the slender-billed rodgersii of the Pacific, which is intermediate in size and has a great variety of color morphs.

    "046.Gadwall": "Gadwall are about the same size as Mallards. Gadwall have a fairly large, square head with a steep forehead. The bill is noticeably thinner than a Mallard's. In flight, the neck is slightly thinner and the wings slightly more slender than a Mallard\u2019s. Slightly smaller than a Mallard; larger than a Green-winged Teal. between crow and goose. Both Sexes. Length: 18.1-22.4 in (46-57 cm). Weight: 17.6-44.1 oz (500-1250 g). Wingspan: 33.1 in (84 cm). Male Gadwall are gray-brown with a black patch at the tail. Females are patterned with brown and buff. Females have a thin orange edge to their dark bills. In flight, both sexes have a white wing patch that is sometimes visible while swimming or resting. Gadwall feed with other dabbling ducks, tipping forward to feed on submerged vegetation without diving. They sometimes steal food from flocks of diving ducks or coots. You'll often see these ducks in pairs through the winter, because they select their mates for the breeding season as early as late fall. Gadwall breed mainly in the Great Plains and prairies. On migration and in winter, look for Gadwall in reservoirs, ponds, fresh and salt water marshes, city parks, sewage ponds, or muddy edges of estuaries. ",
    "047.American_Goldfinch": "A small finch with a short, conical bill and a small, head, long wings, and short, notched tail. Smaller than a Tufted Titmouse. sparrow-sized or smaller. Both Sexes.

Adult males in spring and early summer are bright yellow with black forehead, black wings with white markings, and white patches both above and beneath the tail. Adult females are duller yellow beneath, olive above. Winter birds are drab, unstreaked brown, with blackish wings and two pale wingbars. These are active and acrobatic little finches that cling to weeds and seed socks, and sometimes mill about in large numbers at feeders or on the ground beneath them. Goldfinches fly with a bouncy, undulating pattern and often call in flight, drawing attention to themselves. The goldfinch\u2019s main natural habitats are weedy fields and floodplains, where plants such as thistles and asters are common. They\u2019re also found in cultivated areas, roadsides, orchards, and backyards. American Goldfinches can be found at feeders any time of year, but most abundantly during winter.  One of the most striking features of the American Goldfinch is its vibrant and distinctive plumage, which undergoes a notable change depending on the season. During the breeding season, the males display a stunningly bright and eye-catching plumage. Their heads, necks, and upper chests gleam with a brilliant canary yellow hue, contrasting beautifully with their ebony wings and tail. The wings are adorned with bold white bars and patches, providing an elegant touch to their appearance. The black tail sports bright white edges, making it an instantly recognizable feature when in flight.",
    "048.European_Goldfinch": "Beautiful little finch with a sharp pink bil, cherry-red face, and brilliant black-and-yellow flashes in the wings. Western birds (Europe east to far western Central Asia) have a black-and-white cowl; eastern birds (rest of Central Asia) lack this cowl, and are grayer overall, with more white on the wing. Juvenile (seen in late summer and autumn) has a plain head but is told easily by bold wing pattern. Uses a wide array of wooded and open habitats, from forests and gardens to steppe grasslands and meadows; often feeds on seeding thistles. Forms flocks in autumn and winter, gathering at food sources. Can be inconspicuous, but often detected by pleasant bubbling and twittering calls and song. The average European goldfinch is 12\u201313 cm (4.7\u20135.1 in) long with a wingspan of 21\u201325 cm (8.3\u20139.8 in) and a weight of 14 to 19 g (0.49 to 0.67 oz). The sexes are broadly similar, with a red face, black and white head, warm brown upper parts, white underparts with buff flanks and breast patches, and black and yellow wings. On closer inspection, male European goldfinches can often be distinguished by a larger, darker red mask that extends just behind the eye. The shoulder feathers are black, whereas they are brown on the female. In females, the red face does not extend past the eye. The ivory-coloured bill is long and pointed, and the tail is forked. Goldfinches in breeding condition have a white bill, with a greyish or blackish mark at the tip for the rest of the year. Juveniles have a plain head and a greyer back but are unmistakable due to the yellow wing stripe. Birds in central Asia (the caniceps group) have a plain grey head behind the red face, lacking the black and white head pattern of European and western Asian birds. Adults moult after the breeding season, with some individuals beginning in July and others not completing their moult until November. After moult birds appear less colourful, until the tips of the newly grown feathers wear away. The song is a pleasant silvery twittering. The call is a melodic tickeLIT, and the song is a pleasant tinkling medley of trills and twitters, but always including the tri-syllabic call phrase or a teLLIT-teLLIT-teLLIT. ",
    "050.Eared_Grebe": "A small waterbird with an even smaller head, a thin neck, and a thin bill. It has a sleek oval back and a tailless, fluffy rear. Breeding birds have a crested or peaked head. Larger than a Wilson's Phalarope, smaller than a Mallard. between robin and crow. Both Sexes. Length: 11.8-13.8 in (30-35 cm). Weight: 7.0-25.9 oz (200-735 g). Wingspan: 20.5-21.6 in (52-55 cm). Breeding birds are mostly black with chestnut flanks and golden plumes fanning out from behind the bright red eye. Nonbreeding birds are grayish black overall. The cheeks are smudgy gray and the dark crown extends down past the red eye. The neck is whitish. This social bird breeds in colonies and gathers in flocks from the hundreds to the thousands on lakes and ponds during migration and winter. They swim gracefully across the water and jump up slightly before diving underwater for aquatic invertebrates. Breeds in shallow lakes and ponds. During migration and in winter prefers saltwater. Occurs in great numbers in super salty waters with an abundant supply of brine shrimp and flies.  The plumage of the Eared Grebe changes with the seasons. Breeding adults exhibit a vibrant breeding plumage, showcasing a rich chestnut-toned neck and upperparts. This striking chestnut coloration extends from the back of the head to the upper back, contrasting with their white underparts. During non-breeding periods, the chestnut plumage fades, and the Eared Grebe assumes a more subdued appearance, with a grayish-black neck and white underparts. Additionally, a patch of yellow feathers adorns each side of its head during the breeding season, which serves as a distinctive feature.",
    "052.Pied_billed_Grebe": "Pied-billed Grebes are small, chunky swimming birds. They have compact bodies and slender necks, with relatively large, blocky heads and short, thick bills. They have virtually no tail. Smaller than an American Coot; about the size of a Green-winged Teal. between robin and crow. Both Sexes. Length: 11.8-15.0 in (30-38 cm). Weight: 8.9-20.0 oz (253-568 g). Wingspan: 17.7-24.4 in (45-62 cm). These are brown birds, slightly darker above and more tawny-brown on the underparts. During spring and summer, the crown and nape are dark and the throat is black. While breeding, the bill is whitish with a black band (\u201cpied\u2019), but otherwise is yellow-brown. Juveniles have striped faces. Pied-billed Grebes can adjust their buoyancy and often use this ability to float with just the upper half of the head above the water. They catch small fish and invertebrates by diving or simply slowly submerging. They build floating nests of cattails, grasses, and other vegetation. Look for Pied-billed Grebes on small, quiet ponds and marshes where thick vegetation grows out of the water. In winter they occur on larger water bodies, occasionally in large groups.  As for its plumage, the Pied-billed Grebe boasts a unique combination of brown, black, and white feathers. The adult bird's upperparts are predominantly dark brown or black, while the underparts are largely white. Consequently, this stark contrast in coloration provides excellent camouflage for the bird in its wetland habitats. The name \"pied-billed\" reflects the distinguishing feature of a black band encircling the bird's yellowish bill, creating a visual contrast that helps identify this bird.",

Wingspan: 11.0 in (28 cm). Adult males are deep, rich blue with a tiny black mask in front of the eyes, chestnut wingbars, and a black-and-silver beak. Females are primarily rich cinnamon-brown. The color is richer on the head, paler on the underparts; their tails are bluish. Both sexes have two wingbars; the upper is chestnut and the lower is grayish to buffy. Immature Blue Grosbeaks tend to a rich, dark chestnut brown, with chestnut wingbars. Blue Grosbeaks are unobtrusive despite their bright colors, although in summer males frequently sing their pleasant, rich, warbling songs. Often they sing while perched at high points in the shrubs and small trees of their generally open or shrubby habitats. Listen for their loud, almost metallic chink call. Also watch for this species\u2019 odd habit of twitching its tail sideways. Blue Grosbeaks are characteristic species of old fields beginning to grow back into woodland. They breed in areas covered in a mix of grass, forbs, and shrubs, with usually a few taller trees. In more-arid areas, they often use the shrubby growth along watercourses. ",

They have dark heads with a bright-yellow stripe over the eye. Females and immatures are mostly gray, with white-and-black wings and a greenish-yellow tinge to the neck and flanks. The bill is pale ivory on adult males and greenish-yellow on females. These are social birds that are often found in flocks, particularly in winter. They forage in treetops for insect larvae during the summer, buds in spring, and seeds, berries, and small fruits in winter. They make very erratic movements south into the continental United States in some winters, when they can become common at backyard feeders. Away from backyards, they winter in forests and feed in both deciduous and coniferous trees, often at higher elevations. They breed in spruce-fir, pine-oak, pinyon-juniper, and aspen forests of northern North America and the mountains of the West. There is little geographic variation in plumage, but Evening Grosbeaks do consist of at least three distinct populations, each with distinct call notes. ",

Females and immatures are grayish with tints of reddish orange or yellow on the head and rump. They all have dark gray wings marked by 2 white wingbars. The amount of reddish pink on the bellies of males and the head and rump color on females is variable. Pine Grosbeaks hop among branches to nip off fresh buds and needles or on the ground to grab fallen seeds. Males sing a warbling song from treetops during the breeding season. In the winter they form small groups and travel together in search of seeds and fruits, often showing up at bird feeders. In some winters they move or irrupt farther south in search of food. Pine Grosbeaks inhabit open spruce, fir, and pine forests as well as subalpine forests. In winter they tend to use mountain ash, maple, and ash forests with abundant seeds. Plumage coloration varies across the range of Pine Grosbeaks, but these differences are not consistent. Male Pine Grosbeaks in California are often more orangeish and females more yellowish. Birds in the interior West tend to have less red. ",

Females and immatures are brown and heavily streaked, with a bold whitish stripe over the eye. Males flash pink-red under the wings; females flash yellowish. Both sexes show white patches in the wings and tail. These chunky birds use their stout bills to eat seeds, fruit, and insects. They are also frequent visitors to backyard bird feeders, where they eat sunflower seeds with abandon. The sweet, rambling song of a male Rose-breasted Grosbeak is a familiar voice of eastern forests; their sharp \u201cchink\u201d calls are also very distinctive. Rose-breasted Grosbeaks breed in eastern forests; you can find them among both deciduous trees and conifers. They are most common in regenerating woodlands and often concentrate along forest edges and in parks.

Juveniles are similar but with grayish feathers on the head, neck, and sides and less white in the upperwing. The Pigeon Guillemot dives and swims underwater, flapping its wings for propulsion. It catches fish, worms, and crustaceans one at a time, seizing them from between rocks, among algae, or in the water. It usually forages alone and away from other species as well. Breeds in rocky crevices along the coast or on islands and feeds very near nest sites. Nests on rocky islands, shorelines, and cliffs. Forages near the ocean shoreline and in openings in sea ice. Ornithologists recognize five subspecies that differ mostly in size: eureka in Oregon and California; adianta from Washington to the central Aleutians; kaiurka in the west-central Aleutians and the Commander Islands; columba from the Bering Strait to the Kamchatka Peninsula of Russia. The subspecies of Pigeon Guillemot that inhabits the Kuril Islands of Japan, snowi, has little to no white in the upperwing, unlike other subspecies. ",

Breeding adult California Gulls are white-headed gulls with a medium gray back, yellow legs, and a dark eye. Nonbreeding adults have brown streaking on the head. Adults have a yellow bill with small black ring and a red spot on the lower mandible\u2014brighter on breeding gulls. In their first year, they are mottled brown and white and often have a paler face. The bill is pink with a black tip and the legs are pinkish. Second-year California Gulls are also mottled brown but begin to show gray on the back. They have a dark eye and bluish legs. Third-year gulls look very similar to adults. California Gulls are strong, nimble fliers and opportunistic foragers; they forage on foot, from the air, and from the water. These social gulls breed in colonies and mix with other gull species along the coast in winter. California Gulls breed on sparsely vegetated islands and levees in inland lakes and rivers. They forage in any open area where they can find food including garbage dumps, scrublands, pastures, orchards, meadows, and farms. In the winter they forage along the Pacific Coast and use mostly marine areas including mudflats, estuaries, deltas, and beaches. Two different subspecies of California Gull exist. The gulls that breed in the Great Basin region of the western United States are smaller and darker backed, and those breeding in the Great Plains are larger and paler. ",

Wingspan: 53.9-57.5 in (137-146 cm). Adults have light-gray backs, black wingtips, and white heads and underparts. In winter, dusky streaks mark their heads. Herring Gulls take four years to reach adult plumage. Juveniles are mottled brown; second-year birds are brown but show gray on the back. Third-years have more gray on the back and more white on the head and underparts. The legs are dull pink at all ages. Herring Gulls patrol shorelines and open ocean, picking scraps off the surface. Rallying around fishing boats or refuse dumps, they are loud and competitive scavengers, happy to snatch another bird's meal. They spend much of their time perched near food sources, often in congregations of gulls. Look for Herring Gulls in winter along coasts and near large reservoirs, lakes, and major rivers. They feed in habitats as diverse as open water, mudflats, plowed fields, and garbage dumps, and gather in almost any open space near food. In summer, they\u2019re most likely to be seen along the Atlantic Coast, Great Lakes, and coastal Alaska; they also breed across the boreal far north. Herring Gulls vary considerably across the Northern Hemisphere, and this combined with their tendency to hybridize with other gull species causes headaches in both taxonomy and identification. By sight, the different types of Herring Gulls are difficult to distinguish, and only the American Herring Gull (Larus argentatus smithsonianus) is likely to be seen in North America. European Herring Gulls (L . a. argentatus) and Yellow-legged Gulls (Larus michahellis, recently designated a separate species) are very rare visitors to eastern North America. The Vega Gull (L. a. vegae), a subspecies with a darker gray back, breeds in northwest Alaska and northeast Asia, but is very rare in the rest of North America. ",

Juncos vary across the country (see Regional Differences), but in general they\u2019re dark gray or brown birds brightened up by a pink bill and white outer tail feathers that periodically flash open, particularly in flight. Dark-eyed Juncos are birds of the ground. They hop around the bases of trees and shrubs in forests or venture out onto lawns looking for fallen seeds. You\u2019ll often hear their high chip notes, given almost absent-mindedly while foraging, or intensifying as they take short, low flights through cover. Dark-eyed Juncos breed in coniferous or mixed-coniferous forests across Canada, the western U.S., and in the Appalachians. During winter you\u2019ll find them in open woodlands, fields, parks, roadsides, and backyards. There is a huge range of geographic variation in the Dark-eyed Junco. Among the 15 described races, six forms are easily recognizable in the field and five used to be considered separate species until the 1980s. A field guide is the best place to look for complete illustration of ranges and plumages, but in general there are two widespread forms of the Dark-eyed Junco: \u201cslate-colored\u201d junco of the eastern United States and most of Canada, which is smooth gray above; and \u201cOregon\u201d junco, found across much of the western U.S., with a dark hood, warm brown back and rufous flanks. Other more restricted variations include the slate-colored-like \u201cwhite-winged\u201d and Oregon-like \u201cpink-sided\u201d juncos of the Rockies and western Great Plains; and the Yellow-eyed Junco-like \u201cred-backed\u201d and \u201cgray-headed\u201d juncos of the Southwest.

It has a whitish throat and dark gray-brown wings and tail. Forages by catching large flying insects on the wing, sallying out from a favored perch (often a telephone line) and returning to it to consume the prey. Also feeds on fruits, particularly during cooler weather. Perches conspicuously and when nesting flies out to confront many sorts of birds that come too close to the nest. Found in almost any open or semiopen habitat in most of the range; in the United States, favors parks, towns, and rural areas with scattered trees for nesting and other perches for hunting, often near water. Ornithologists recognize three subspecies, which differ mostly in intensity of their plumage colors: satrapa from the United States south to Venezuela; despotes in eastern Brazil; and the larger melancholicus across the remainder of South America. Both despotes and melancholicus are more vividly yellow below than satrapa.  One of the most striking visual features of the Tropical Kingbird is its vibrant plumage. The upperparts of its body, including the head, back, wings, and tail, are a dazzling shade of olive-green. This coloration helps it blend seamlessly into the lush foliage of its tropical habitat. In contrast, the underparts are pale yellow, which extends from its throat to its belly. This distinct color contrast makes the bird easily identifiable, even from a distance.",

As its name suggests, the Gray Kingbird showcases predominantly gray plumage, which blankets its head, back, wings, and tail. The feathers on its underparts, however, can be slightly lighter in tone, often featuring a subtle whitish hue. The overall gray coloration of the Gray Kingbird\u2019s plumage endows the bird with a timeless elegance. To complement its gray feathers, the Gray Kingbird possesses a contrasting black mask, extending across its eyes, which adds a dash of intrigue to its appearance. This distinctive facial marking continues downwards, framing the sides of its beak before tapering off at the throat. A striking white band, resembling a necklace, adorns the lower section of its neck, lending a touch of distinction to the otherwise monochromatic palette of its plumage.",
    "080.Green_Kingfisher": "A small kingfisher with a very long, pointed bill, rather long tail, and short, rather narrow wings.

Adults are green with a white collar and white spangling in the wings; and white below with dark green belly spots. Males have a rufous breast; females have a double green breast band. Juveniles resemble adult females but may have a bronze tinge to the crown. Perches low over water, then makes quick dives to capture prey in the bill. Rarely hovers. While perched, often jerks the head and tail upward. Nests in riverbank burrows. Freshwater sites with clear water and plenty of vegetation along the edges, including rivers, creeks, streams, ditches, ponds, lakes, and resacas (oxbow lakes). Of the five very similar subspecies recognized by ornithologists, only hachisukai occurs in the United States. It is strongly marked in the wing and has a bronzy green rather than blue-green sheen in the upperparts. The subspecies found farther south (septentrionalis, americana, cabanisii, and mathewsii) differ mostly in size and in the extent of white markings in the wings, dark markings in the underparts, and the tone of green in the plumage.

    "081.Pied_Kingfisher": "Boldly marked black-and-white kingfisher with short, bushy crest and glossy all-dark bill. Superficially similar to Crested Kingfisher, but smaller, with a much more distinctly patterned head and breast and less erect crest. Frequently seen perched in pairs or small groups. Often hovers over water when seeking prey. Inhabits a wide range of waterside habitats, from lakes to estuaries to mangroves. Gives a variety of sharp notes, as well as dry trilling and rattling calls. This is a medium-sized kingfisher, about 25 cm (9.8 in) long with a white with a black mask, a white supercilium and black breast bands. The crest is neat and the upperparts are barred in black. Several subspecies are recognized within the broad distribution. The nominate race is found in sub-Saharan Africa, extending into West Asia. The subspecies syriacus is a larger northern bird similar to the nominate subspecies (following Bergmann's rule). Subspecies leucomelanura is found from Afghanistan east into India, Thailand and Southeast Asia. The subspecies travancoreensis of the Western Ghats is darker with the white reduced. The subspecies C. r. insignis is found in Hainan and southeastern China and has a much larger bill. Males have a narrow second breast-band while females have a single broken breast band.  Color: This bird's coloration is instantly captivating. The Pied Kingfisher exhibits a striking black and white contrast across its plumage, lending it a distinguished appearance. The upperparts of its body, including the head, back, and wings, are predominantly black, contrasting beautifully with the clean, bright white underparts. Its tail is also black, extending beyond the wings and adding a sense of elegance during flight. These bold colors make the Pied Kingfisher easily distinguishable among various avian species.",

Male Horned Larks are sandy to rusty brown above, with a black chest band, a curving black mask, and head stripes that extend to the back of the head (sometimes raised into tiny \u201chorns\u201d). The face and throat are either yellow or white (see Regional Differences). The underparts are white. Females have similar head and breast patterns but are less crisply defined. Horned Larks are social birds, sometimes found in huge flocks outside the breeding season. They creep along bare ground searching for small seeds and insects. They often mix with other open-country species in winter flocks, including longspurs and Snow Buntings. The barer the ground, the more Horned Larks like it. Look for them in open country with very short or no vegetation, including bare agricultural fields. They breed in short grassland, short-stature sage shrubland, desert, and even alpine and arctic tundra. Horned Larks vary in color across North America. Some arctic-breeding birds have little or no yellow on the head, while Eastern and south Texas breeders have the head extensively yellow. Those breeding along the Pacific coast tend to be a brighter rufous on the nape, upper back, shoulders, and sides; elsewhere they are a sandier brown. ",
    "087.Mallard": "Mallards are large ducks with hefty bodies, rounded heads, and wide, flat bills. Like many \u201cdabbling ducks\u201d the body is long and the tail rides high out of the water, giving a blunt shape. In flight their wings are broad and set back toward the rear.

Mallards are \u201cdabbling ducks\u201d\u2014they feed in the water by tipping forward and grazing on underwater plants. They almost never dive. They can be very tame ducks especially in city ponds, and often group together with other Mallards and other species of dabbling ducks. Mallards can live in almost any wetland habitat, natural or artificial. Look for them on lakes, ponds, marshes, rivers, and coastal habitats, as well as city and suburban parks and residential backyards. ",
    "088.Western_Meadowlark": "The Western Meadowlark is the size of a robin but chunkier and shorter-tailed, with a flat head, long, slender bill, and a round-shouldered posture that nearly conceals its neck. The wings are rounded and short for the bird\u2019s size and the tail is short, stiff, and spiky. About the size of an American Robin, but with a shorter tail. robin-sized. Both Sexes. Length: 6.3-10.2 in (16-26 cm). Weight: 3.1-4.1 oz (89-115 g). Wingspan: 16.1 in (41 cm). Western Meadowlarks have yellow underparts with intricately patterned brown, black and buff upperparts. A black \u201cV\u201d crosses the bright yellow breast; it is gray in winter. Contrasting stripes of dark brown and light buff mark the head. The outer tail feathers flash white in flight. Look for Western Meadowlarks foraging on the ground alone or, in winter, in small, loose flocks. When flushed, Western Meadowlarks fly low, wings below the horizontal, gliding and flapping with short, stiff, quail-like wingbeats. In spring and summer, males sing out from atop fence posts, bushes, power lines, and other high points. Western Meadowlarks seek the wide open spaces of native grasslands and agricultural fields for spring and summer breeding and winter foraging. Look for them among low to medium-height grasses more so than in tall fields. They also occur along the weedy verges of roads, marsh edges, and mountain meadows up to 10,000 feet. ",
    "089.Hooded_Merganser": "Hooded Mergansers are small ducks with a thin bill and a fan-shaped, collapsible crest that makes the head look oversized and oblong.

The black head has a large white patch that varies in size when the crest is raised or lowered, but is always prominent. Females and immatures are gray and brown, with warm tawny-cinnamon tones on the head. Hooded Mergansers dive to catch aquatic insects, crayfish, and small fish. Males court females by expanding their white, sail-like crests and making very low, gravelly, groaning calls. Hooded Mergansers fly distinctively, with shallow, very rapid wingbeats. Look for Hooded Mergansers on small bodies of freshwater. In summer, these small ducks nest in holes in trees, often near freshwater ponds or rivers. For winter, they move to larger bodies of freshwater, marshes, and protected saltwater bays.  In terms of coloration, both males and females possess a unique and eye-catching blend of black, white, and chestnut tones. The male Hooded Merganser is particularly striking, adorned with a glossy black head and upper body. Its lower body and wings, however, feature a brilliant white plumage. The contrast between the dark and light colors creates a stunning visual spectacle. Additionally, the male possesses a prominent white crest on its head that can be erected into a charming display during courtship or aggressive encounters. The female, on the other hand, sports a more subdued appearance, with a brownish-gray body, a cinnamon-colored crest, and a white patch around its eye.",
    "090.Red_breasted_Merganser": "A large, slim, and long-bodied diving duck with a fairly long neck and a long, thin, serrated bill. A shaggy crest of feathers gives the head a distinctive profile.

Breeding males have a cinnamon chest, a white neck band, and a shaggy green head. Female and nonbreeding males are brownish gray overall with a brownish chin, a dingy breast, and a brown shaggy head. In flight both sexes have a prominent white lower wing panel. Red-breasted Mergansers tend to sit low in the water and fly at an angle with the head higher than their feet. They swim with the head partially submerged, diving underwater to capture small fish with their serrated bill. Breeds in the boreal forest on fresh, brackish, and saltwater wetlands, typically close to the coast. During migration and on the wintering grounds, uses marine waters, lakes, and rivers. They tend to use saltwater, including estuaries and bays, more often than Common Merganser.  The Red-breasted Merganser has a streamlined and slender body, perfectly adapted for its water-based lifestyle. Its long and slender bill is serrated, which aids in capturing and gripping its prey. The male possesses a powerful neck with distinctive black markings, while the females have a more uniform brownish-gray feather pattern all over their body. This sexual dimorphism is quite pronounced in the species.",
    "092.Nighthawk": "Lesser Nighthawks are small nighthawks with rounded wings and a fairly long, notched tail. In flight they look long and slim, but when perched they look rather full-bodied with a small, flat head. They have a very small, thin bill that is nearly invisible and tiny legs. Larger than a Violet-green Swallow, smaller than a Barn Owl. between robin and crow. Both Sexes. Length: 7.9-9.1 in (20-23 cm). Weight: 1.6-1.8 oz (45-50 g). Wingspan: 21.6 in (55 cm). Lesser Nighthawks are camouflaged in browns and grays. It is not until they take flight that a distinctive bar across the wingtips is visible. The bar is white on males and cream-colored on females. Males and females also have a white stripe across the front of the neck. Males have an additional thin white band across the base of the tail. During the day Lesser Nighthawks rest quietly, perfectly camouflaged on the ground or in a tree or shrub, so much so that they are easy to miss. At dusk and dawn they fly on buoyant wings skimming the ground and tops of shrubs and trees to capture flying insects with their mouth wide open. Its flight is butterfly-like as it flaps and glides with its wings held in a V. Lesser Nighthawks can be found in deserts, open country, and scrubby areas most of the year. Common Nighthawks are medium-sized, slender birds with very long, pointed wings and medium-long tails. Only the small tip of the bill is usually visible, and this combined with the large eye and short neck gives the bird a big-headed look. Slightly smaller than an American Kestrel; larger than a Purple Martin. Common Nighthawks are well camouflaged in gray, white, buff, and black. The long, dark wings have a striking white blaze about two-thirds of the way out to the tip. In flight, a V-shaped white throat patch contrasts with the rest of the bird\u2019s mottled plumage. Look for Common Nighthawks flying in looping patterns in mornings and evenings. Common Nighthawks are most visible when they forage on the wing over open areas near woods or wetlands. They nest on the ground in open areas such as gravel bars, forest clearings, coastal sand dunes, or sparsely vegetated grasslands. ",

Smaller than an American Crow; about the size of a Steller\u2019s Jay but more compact. between robin and crow. Both Sexes. Clark\u2019s Nutcrackers are pale gray birds with black wings. In flight, the wings show large white patches along the trailing edges (secondaries). The tail is black in the center with broad white along either side. Nutcrackers have black bills, legs, and feet. Nutcrackers travel in flocks and use their spike-like bills to pick seeds out of pine cones. They eat some of the seeds and bury thousands of others for the winter. Nutcrackers fly on broad, floppy wings and make rolling, gravelly calls audible from far away. Clark\u2019s Nutcrackers are birds of the mountains. They are closely associated with pines that produce large seeds, such as whitebark pine and limber pine, but are also found in other montane evergreen forests from about 3,000 to more than 11,000 feet in the West.  The wings and tail of the Clark's Nutcracker are significant contributors to its visual identity. The wings are long and pointed, allowing for agile flight in mountainous environments, and are predominantly black with a sheen of bluish-gray. When in flight, the white patches on the outer edges of the wings become apparent, showcasing distinctive white wingtips. Notably, these white patches are also visible when the bird is at rest, serving as a distinguishing feature in identifying the Clark's Nutcracker.",

The tail is very short, and the long, narrow bill is straight or slightly upturned. Larger than a Red-breasted Nuthatch; smaller than a Tufted Titmouse. sparrow-sized or smaller. Both Sexes. Length: 5.1-5.5 in (13-14 cm). Weight: 0.6-1.1 oz (18-30 g). Wingspan: 7.9-10.6 in (20-27 cm). White-breasted Nuthatches are gray-blue on the back, with a frosty white face and underparts. The black or gray cap and neck frame the face and make it look like this bird is wearing a hood. The lower belly and under the tail are often chestnut. White-breasted Nuthatches are agile birds that creep along trunks and large branches, probing into bark furrows with their straight, pointed bills. Like other nuthatches, they often turn sideways and upside down on vertical surfaces as they forage. They don\u2019t lean against their tails the way woodpeckers do. White-breasted Nuthatches are birds of mature woods and woodland edges. They\u2019re particularly associated with deciduous stands, including maple, hickory, basswood, and oak, though they can be found in some coniferous forests.  Another noteworthy physical characteristic is the black cap that adorns its head. This cap extends from the forehead to the nape, sharply contrasting with the bird's white face. A thin black line runs through its eyes, accentuating their intensity. These dark features add to the bird's charm and give it a distinctive appearance. Additionally, the White-breasted Nuthatch possesses strong claws and a short, strong beak, perfectly adapted for its foraging behavior.",

Adult males are black above and rich reddish-chestnut below. They have a black head and throat, with a reddish-chestnut patch at the bend of the wing. Females are greenish yellow with two white wing bars and no black. Immature males look like females, but have black around the bill and throat. Orchard Orioles forage for insects in the tops of trees. They also drink nectar from flowers and, in fall, eat berries and other fruits. They sometimes visit hummingbird feeders or eat orange slices or jelly at feeding stations. Orchard Orioles spend summers in open woodlands and areas of scattered trees across the eastern United States and southern Canada. Look for them along river edges, in pastures with scattered trees, and in parks and orchards.  In comparison, the female Orchard Oriole exhibits a more modest appearance. Her feathers are primarily olive-green, blending well with the vegetation and ensuring camouflage while nesting and foraging. Like the male, she also boasts the distinctive contrast of black on her head, wings, and tail, but her underparts are a paler yellowish-orange instead of the male's vibrant red. This difference in colors helps to distinguish the genders, ensuring easy identification in the field.",
    "099.Ovenbird": "The Ovenbird is a chunky, larger-than-average warbler, but still smaller than a Song Sparrow. It has a round head, fairly thick bill for a warbler, and a jaunty tail often cocked upward. Slightly larger than a Yellow Warbler; smaller than an Eastern Bluebird. sparrow-sized or smaller. Both Sexes. Length: 4.3-5.5 in (11-14 cm). Weight: 0.6-1.0 oz (16-28 g). Wingspan: 7.5-10.2 in (19-26 cm). Ovenbirds are olive-green above and spotted below, with bold black-and-orange crown stripes. A white eyering gives it a somewhat surprised expression. Like several other terrestrial, or near-terrestrial, warblers, Ovenbirds have pink legs. Ovenbirds spend much of their time foraging on the ground, often walking with a herky-jerky, wandering stroll that is unlike most terrestrial songbirds. Territorial males are very vocal and often sing from tree branches, occasionally quite high up. This is one of the few songbirds that habitually sings in the heat of midafternoon. Ovenbirds breed in closed-canopy forests, particularly deciduous and mixed deciduous-coniferous woods. You may find them in most forest types, from rich oak or maple woods to dry pine forest, although they avoid wet or swampy areas.  One of the Ovenbird's unique visual features is its distinctive crown. As the species name suggests, the top of its head, or crown, is adorned with a bright orange-brown patch, giving it a capped appearance. This crown is bordered by two broad, dark brown stripes that extend down to its bright, bold eyes, creating a striking facial pattern. The eyes themselves are large and glossy, often reflecting the light and revealing the bird's alert and curious nature.",

Wingspan: 78.7 in (200 cm). Adult Brown Pelicans are gray-brown birds with yellow heads and white necks. In breeding plumage, the back and sides of the neck turn a rich, dark reddish-brown. Immatures are gray-brown above (including the head and neck) with pale whitish belly and breast. Brown Pelicans feed by plunging into the water, stunning small fish with the impact of their large bodies and scooping them up in their expandable throat pouches. When not foraging, pelicans stand around fishing docks, jetties, and beaches or cruise the shoreline. In flight, lines of pelicans glide on their broad wings, often surfing updrafts along wave faces or cliffs. Their wingbeats are slow, deep, and powerful. Brown Pelicans live along southern and western sea coasts and are rarely seen inland (except at the Salton Sea in California, where they are regular in large numbers). They nest in colonies, often on isolated islands free of land predators. On the Pacific Coast, Brown Pelican adults have red skin on their throats in the breeding season. On the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, Brown Pelicans are slightly smaller and their throat skin is greenish black. ",
    "104.American_Pipit": "A small, slim songbird with a short, thin bill, and medium-length tail, recalling a lark (or a sparrow, but lacking a sparrow\u2019s heavier bill).

Pipits walk energetically through fields in search of food, strutting quickly forward with jerks of the head, almost chickenlike in their gait. Mostly bare terrestrial habitats of many kinds, including tundra, shortgrass plains, alpine meadows, sandbars, mudflats, and many human-made habitats such as airfields, turf farms, harvested agricultural fields, and winter wheat fields. Pipits sometimes perch in bushes. Four subspecies have been described. Over much of the continent, from Alaska to Greenland and south into New England, rubescens is the expected subspecies, and the very similar (if duller) pacificus inhabits the Pacific coastal states and British Columbia. In the Rocky Mountains, the larger subspecies alticola breeds; it has little to no streaking below in breeding plumage and can often show rich rosy or pink hues in the underparts. The very heavily streaked subspecies japonicus breeds mostly in northeastern Asia but is known as a fall and winter vagrant from western Alaska south to California. ",

Wingspan: 17.7-18.9 in (45-48 cm). Like all nightjars, Eastern Whip-poor-wills are patterned with a complicated mottling of gray and brown, which camouflages them nearly perfectly with leaf litter or tree bark. They have a blackish throat bordered at the bottom by a neat, white bib. Males have white corners to the tail; on females, these spots are dull buff. Eastern Whip-poor-wills are strictly nocturnal. At night they rest on the ground or perch horizontally on low trees and fly up to catch moths and other aerial insects. They chant their loud, namesake whip-poor-will song continuously on spring and summer evenings. During the day, Eastern Whip-poor-wills roost on the ground or on a tree limb and are very difficult to spot. Look for Eastern Whip-poor-wills in eastern forests with open understories.

Larger than a Pigeon Guillemot, smaller than a Common Murre. crow-sized. Both Sexes. Breeding adults are blackish with a white face and a yellow bill with a red-orange tip. They have a white breast and belly, and vivid orange feet. Dark, fleshy \u201chorns\u201d extend above the eyes. Nonbreeding adults have sooty gray faces and lose the yellow portion of the bill revealing a smaller, grayish base. Immatures have smaller, all-gray bills compared to adults. Forages by diving and swimming underwater, \u201cflying\u201d with the wings to chase prey, which it catches in the bill and either eats underwater or carries back in the bill to feed young. Near the breeding grounds, often gathers in flocks with many other seabird species. Male and females perform attractive courtship displays with bobbing heads and billing. Nests on rocky seaside cliffs in Siberia, Alaska, and northern British Columbia. Forages in littoral (near-shore) ocean areas when nesting but for most of the year lives and forages only in deep pelagic waters of the central North Pacific, very far from land.  The overall size of the Horned Puffin is relatively compact, measuring around 13 inches (33 cm) in length. It has a robust and stocky build with a short neck and a sturdy, slightly downward-curving beak. The beak, colored in shades of bright red and yellow, is a magnificent adaptation for capturing marine prey, such as fish and invertebrates.",

Common Ravens aren\u2019t as social as crows; you tend to see them alone or in pairs except at food sources like landfills. Ravens are confident, inquisitive birds that strut around or occasionally bound forward with light, two-footed hops. In flight they are buoyant and graceful, interspersing soaring, gliding, and slow flaps. Common Ravens live in open and forest habitats across western and northern North America. This includes deciduous and evergreen forests up to treeline, as well as high desert, sea coast, sagebrush, tundra, and grasslands. They do well around people, particularly rural settlements but also some towns and cities.  Contrasting its striking ebony plumage, the Common Raven features a collection of captivating features that set it apart from other corvids. Under certain light conditions, the feathers on its neck and throat can appear to have a purplish or bluish tint. When viewed up close, these feathers possess a complex pattern, seemingly resembling tiny scales on closer inspection. These intricate feather structures contribute to the remarkable iridescence observed in the sunlight, providing an enchanting visual display.",

American Redstarts are incredibly active insectivores that seem never to stand still. They rapidly spread their cocked tails, exposing the orange or yellow in a quick flash, which often startles insect prey into flushing, whereupon the redstart darts after it, attempting to catch it in the air. American Redstarts breed in open wooded habitats, particularly those dominated by deciduous trees. In migration, the species can be found in nearly any treed habitats. Its tropical winter habitat is in woodlands and open forest at lower and middle elevations.  The American Redstart is a small bird, measuring around 4.5 to 5.5 inches in length, with a wingspan of approximately 6.5 to 7.5 inches. Its body shape is slender and sleek, well-suited for its agile and acrobatic flight as it flits through the trees, actively foraging for insects. The thin bill of the redstart, slightly curved downward, assists in capturing its prey with precision.",

The head has a short crest and the bill is long, heavy, and slightly downcurved. Larger than a Rock Pigeon; about the size (but more slender than) a Common Raven. crow-sized. Both Sexes. Length: 20.5-21.3 in (52-54 cm). Weight: 7.8-19.0 oz (221-538 g). Wingspan: 19.3 in (49 cm). They are tan or brown with extensive blackish streaking on the upperparts and chest. The crown is black with small, pale spots, and they have a patch of bare, blue skin behind the eye. The wings are dark with white highlights. Greater Roadrunners spend most of their lives on the ground hunting lizards, small mammals, and birds. They are very fast runners, leaning over parallel to the ground with their tails streaming behind them. They are weak fliers, but you may see them perched above the ground on fence posts and sometimes telephone wires. Greater Roadrunners are characteristic birds of the hot, shrubby expanses of the Desert Southwest. They aren\u2019t restricted to deserts, though: look for them in open country with patches of shrubs or small trees almost as far east as the Mississippi River. ",

The gray head contrasts with the wide, black mask, black bill, and white throat. The tail is black with white corners; the wings are black with white at the base of the primaries that form a small \u201chandkerchief\u201d spot when the wing is closed and larger white patches in flight. Juveniles have darker barring above and below. Loggerhead Shrikes sit on low, exposed perches and scan for rodents, lizards, birds, and insects. They eat smaller prey (such as ground beetles) right away, but they are famous for impaling larger items on thorns or barbed wire to be eaten later. The species often hovers. When flying it uses bursts of very rapid wingbeats. Open country with scattered shrubs and trees is the typical habitat of Loggerhead Shrike, but the species can also be found in more heavily wooded habitats with large openings and in very short habitats with few or no trees. Shrikes from eastern North America have pale to medium-gray rumps. Loggerhead Shrikes from the Interior West have white rumps similar to those of Northern Shrikes. Loggerhead Shrikes breeding in southern California are slightly darker above and much darker below. An endangered subspecies of Loggerhead Shrike from San Clemente Island, in southern California, is the darkest gray of all. ",

Nelson\u2019s Sparrows walk or run through within wetland vegetation and across small openings, often feeding from the ground. They also seek seeds and insects higher in the marsh vegetation. They sometimes perch on top of shrubs. In the interior of the continent, birds nest in freshwater wetlands in the taiga (boreal forest) and prairie, especially marshes with reeds, sedges, rushes, and cordgrass but also during wet years in farm fields. The coastal form (\u201cAtlantic\u201d) nest mostly in tidal marshes, both saltwater and brackish, as well as in farm fields during wet years on occasion. Three subspecies are recognized: nelsoni (Yukon to Minnesota), alter (Hudson Bay to James Bay), and subvirgata (Canadian Maritimes to Massachusetts). The very similar-looking nelsoni and alter forms show very few genetic differences, whereas the pale subvirgata (known as the \u201cAtlantic\u201d or \u201cAcadian\u201d form) is genetically quite different from both and from Saltmarsh Sparrow; it is potentially a separate species.

Saltmarshes, including brackish marshes and (in the Everglades) freshwater marshes. Ornithologists recognize seven subspecies of Seaside Sparrow. The northernmost, maritima, breeds from Maine to northern North Carolina; it is migratory and winters from Virginia to northern Florida. From central North Carolina to southern Georgia, the similar A. m. macgillivraii is resident. Both subspecies are moderately dark overall, with macgillivraii slightly smaller and having thicker dark streaking below than maritima. On Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast, from Tampa to the panhandle, peninsulae resembles macgillivraii but has a more brownish, not grayish back. The other subspecies in the Gulf of Mexico region differ more noticeably. The subspecies fisheri, resident from Alabama to eastern Texas, has bright buff tones in the face and upper breast, and its back is more olive in tone, its wings chestnut in color. To the south on the Texas coast, the subspecies sennetti has less vivid buff tones and a mostly unstreaked greenish back. Where the ranges of these two meet in central Texas, birds appear intermediate in plumage. In Florida, in freshwater marshes of the Everglades, the subspecies mirabilis (Cape Sable Seaside Sparrow) is resident and listed as Endangered. It is distinctive: whitish with narrow brownish streaks below; white streaks above in fresh plumage. Finally, Florida also had a very dark subspecies, nigrescens, which inhabited the Atlantic coast marshes. It became extinct in 1987. It was known as the Dusky Seaside Sparrow. ",

Look for White-crowned Sparrows in places where safe tangles of brush mix with open or grassy ground for foraging. For much of the United States, White-crowned Sparrows are most likely in winter (although two races live year round in the West, along the coast and in the mountains). White-crowned Sparrows that breed along the Pacific Coast tend to have yellow bills and duller white head stripes. Birds that breed from Alaska to Hudson Bay tend to have orange bills and white or gray lores. Birds that breed east of Hudson Bay and in the Rockies tend to have pink bills with black lores that merge with the black head stripes. ",
    "133.White_throated_Sparrow": "The White-throated Sparrow is a large, full-bodied sparrow with a fairly prominent bill, rounded head, long legs, and long, narrow tail. Slightly larger than a Song Sparrow. sparrow-sized or smaller. Both Sexes. Length: 6.3-7.1 in (16-18 cm). Weight: 0.8-1.1 oz (22-32 g). Wingspan: 7.9-9.1 in (20-23 cm). White-throated Sparrows are brown above and gray below with a striking head pattern. The black-and-white-striped head is augmented by a bright white throat and yellow between the eye and the bill, which is gray. You\u2019ll also see a less boldly marked form, known as \u201ctan-striped,\u201d with a buff-on-brown face pattern instead of white-on-black. White-throated Sparrows stay near the ground, scratching through leaves in search of food, often in flocks. You may see them low in bushes as well, particularly in spring when they eat fresh buds. White-throated Sparrows sing their distinctive songs frequently, even in winter. Look for White-throated Sparrows in woods, at forest edges, in the regrowth that follows logging or forest fires, at pond and bog edges, and in copses near treeline. In winter you can find these birds in thickets, overgrown fields, parks, and woodsy suburbs. They readily come to backyards for birdseed. ",
    "134.Cape_Glossy_Starling": "A medium-sized iridescent blue-green glossy starling that lacks dark ear-patches and has greenish flanks and belly, giving it a more uniform appearance than the \u201cblue-eared\u201d starlings. Pairs and small groups occupy high-altitude grassland, Karoo, and savanna, including drier habitats than other glossy starlings. The species feeds on the ground and in trees on fruit and insects; often it scavenges from people. It gives a rolling \u201cturrreaau\u201d flight call and harsh \u201ckarrr\u201d alarm notes. Similar \u201cblue-eared\u201d starlings differ from Cape Starling by being smaller and having blue-magenta flanks and belly that give them a less uniform appearance. The Cape starling has an adult length of about 25 cm (10 in) and weight of about 100 grams (3.5 oz). The plumage of an adult bird is a fairly uniform bright, glossy colour. The head is blue with darker ear coverts and the upper parts of the body are greenish-blue. It has a lengthy warbling song which may include an imitation of sounds it hears in its environment.  In terms of physical appearance, the Cape Glossy Starling exhibits several distinguishing features. With an average length of about 23 centimeters, it is characterized by a medium-sized body. The bird has a sleek, slim shape with a slightly elevated posture, showcasing a sense of elegance. Its vibrant plumage is the primary highlight, displaying a glossy iridescence that dazzles in hues of deep purple, metallic green, cobalt blue, and turquoise. These iridescent colors usually appear more intense when exposed to direct sunlight or bright natural light. The Cape Glossy Starling possesses a long, pointed beak that is black in color, adding to its overall striking appearance. This beak is perfectly adapted for the bird's feeding habits, allowing it to forage for various food sources efficiently. The eyes of this starling are dark brown or black, standing out as small, shiny orbs within its bright plumage. The legs and feet of the Cape Glossy Starling are strong and well-developed, allowing it to perch and move with ease.",
    "136.Barn_Swallow": "When perched, the sparrow-sized Barn Swallow appears cone shaped, with a slightly flattened head, no visible neck, and broad shoulders that taper to long, pointed wings. The tail extends well beyond the wingtips and the long outer feathers give the tail a deep fork. Slightly smaller than a bluebird; slightly larger than a Tree Swallow. sparrow-sized or smaller. Both Sexes. Length: 5.9-7.5 in (15-19 cm). Weight: 0.6-0.7 oz (17-20 g). Wingspan: 11.4-12.6 in (29-32 cm). Barn Swallows have a steely blue back, wings, and tail, and rufous to tawny underparts. The blue crown and face contrast with the cinnamon-colored forehead and throat. White spots under the tail can be difficult to see except in flight. Males are more boldly colored than females. Barn Swallows feed on the wing, snagging insects from just above the ground or water to heights of 100 feet or more. They fly with fluid wingbeats in bursts of straight flight, rarely gliding, and can execute quick, tight turns and dives. When aquatic insects hatch, Barn Swallows may join other swallow species in mixed foraging flocks. You can find the adaptable Barn Swallow feeding in open habitats from fields, parks, and roadway edges to marshes, meadows, ponds, and coastal waters. Their nests are often easy to spot under the eaves or inside of sheds, barns, bridges and other structures. ",
    "137.Cliff_Swallow": "These compact swallows have rounded, broad-based wings, a small head, and a medium-length, squared tail. Smaller than a Purple Martin; slightly larger than a Bank Swallow. sparrow-sized or smaller. Both Sexes. Length: 5.1 in (13 cm). Weight: 0.7-1.2 oz (19-34 g). Wingspan: 11.0-11.8 in (28-30 cm). In poor light, Cliff Swallows look brownish with dark throats and white underparts. In good light you\u2019ll see their metallic, dark-blue backs and pale, pumpkin-colored rumps. They have rich, brick-red faces and a bright buff-white forehead patch like a headlamp. Some juveniles show whitish throats in summer and fall. Cliff Swallows zoom around in intricate aerial patterns to catch insects on the wing. When feeding in flocks with other species of swallows, they often stay higher in the air. They build mud nests in colonies on cliff ledges or under bridges, eaves, and culverts. Cliff Swallows traditionally built their nests on vertical cliff faces. With the expansion of road infrastructure they have adopted many bridges, overpasses, and culverts as their colonial nesting sites. They feed in areas near and over water, frequently mixing with other species of swallows. Most Cliff Swallows in North America have whitish foreheads; however, birds from the Mexican population (which extends into the southwest U.S.) have dark chestnut foreheads. ",

The head is fairly large and the tail is somewhat short and broad. Slightly smaller than a Northern Cardinal; larger than a Yellow Warbler. between sparrow and robin. Both Sexes. Length: 6.3-6.7 in (16-17 cm). Weight: 0.8-1.3 oz (23-38 g). Wingspan: 9.8-11.4 in (25-29 cm). In spring and summer, adult males are an unmistakable, brilliant red with black wings and tails. Females and fall immatures are olive-yellow with darker olive wings and tails. After breeding, adult males molt to female-like plumage, but with black wings and tail. Primarily insectivorous during the summer, Scarlet Tanagers also eat fruit during migration and on the wintering grounds. They spend much of their time skulking among the wide leaves of deciduous trees in the forest canopy, where they are hard to see. They sing a burry, rambling song and give a distinctive, harsh chick-burr call. Scarlet Tanagers breed in deciduous and mixed deciduous-evergreen forests in eastern North America. They are somewhat sensitive to habitat fragmentation, so look for them in large, undisturbed tracts of forest. During migration, they move through a broader variety of forest and shrubby habitats, as well as backyards. ",

Smaller than an American Robin; larger than a Yellow Warbler. between sparrow and robin. Both Sexes. Adult male Summer Tanagers are entirely bright red. Females and immature males are bright yellow-green\u2014yellower on the head and underparts and slightly greener on the back and wings. The bill is pale. Molting immature males can be patchy yellow and red. Summer Tanagers tend to stay fairly high in the forest canopy, where they sit still and then sally out to catch flying insects in midair, or move slowly along tree branches to glean food. Males have a sweet, whistling song similar to an American Robin; both sexes give a distinctive pit-ti-tuck call note. They breed near gaps and edges of open forests, particularly of deciduous trees or mixed pine-oak woodlands. In the Southwest, look for them along streams among willows, cottonwoods, mesquite, or saltcedar.  The appearance of a Summer Tanager is visually distinct, making it relatively easy to identify. Males boast a vibrant and intense red plumage from head to tail, reminiscent of a glowing ember or a ripened cherry. Their captivating red coloring is uniform throughout their body, creating a striking contrast against green foliage or the clear blue sky. This fiery red hue is so unique that it is often described as vermillion or scarlet. In contrast, the females exhibit subtle changes in coloration. They have a brilliant yellowish-green body, while their wings and tails feature a blend of muted olive and gray tones. Juvenile Summer Tanagers have a more earth-toned appearance, with a brownish wash over their plumage. Moving beyond their striking colors, Summer Tanagers have a compact and robust build. They are medium-sized songbirds, measuring around 7 to 7.5 inches (18 to 19 centimeters) in length, with a wingspan of approximately 12 inches (30 centimeters). Their bills are slightly thicker than most other tanagers, with a slightly hooked tip that aids them in catching insects mid-flight. The shape of their body is relatively stocky and rounded, with strong wings that enable swift and agile flight through the forest canopy.",

Nonbreeding birds have a white forehead with smaller black cap restricted to the back of the head and neck. Nonbreeders also have a black bill, black legs, and a dark gray bar across the shoulder (carpal bar). Arctic Terns fly gracefully with rowing wingbeats over open waters, diving down to pick fish from or just below the water's surface. They tend to hover above foraging areas and nesting colonies more often than the similar Common Tern. They migrate over the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans often far out to sea. Arctic Terns breed across the Arctic in treeless areas with little to no vegetation, in open boreal forests, and on islands and barrier beaches on the northeastern Atlantic Coast. They migrate over the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans to food-rich waters around Antarctica where they hang out on pack ice during the Southern Hemisphere's summer. ",

Green-tailed Towhees are grayish birds with olive-yellow wings, back and tail.  The head is strongly marked with a bright rufous crown, white throat, and a dark \u201cmustache\u201d stripe.  Green-tailed Towhees forage on the ground or in dense shrubby foliage.  They can be hard to see except when males sing from the top of a shrub.  Their call, a quiet, catlike mew, can help you find them.  Look for Green-tailed Towhees in shrubby habitats of the West, particularly disturbed areas of montane forest and open slopes in the Great Basin, sagebrush steppes, and high desert.  The overall appearance of the Green-tailed Towhee is characterized by its robust build and a long, rounded tail.    The towhee's body structure is well adapted for ground-dwelling, as it possesses relatively short legs and a powerful, seed-crushing bill.  One of the most striking features of the Green-tailed Towhee is its vibrant plumage. The upperparts of the male are primarily colored in shades of rich, olive-green, which extend from the back to the rump and tail. The tail is particularly notable, showcasing bright green feathers that truly capture the observer's attention. In contrast, the female sports a more subdued plumage; her upperparts are generally a warm brown, and her tail possesses olive-green tones rather than the vivid green of the male. Regardless of gender, both males and females share the characteristic reddish-brown crown that contrasts beautifully with the rest of their plumage.    Moving towards the ventral side, the Green-tailed Towhee exhibits a combination of lighter and darker hues. The underparts of both genders are tawny in color, gradually fading into a pale cream towards their undertail coverts. This color variation provides excellent camouflage amid the understory vegetation where they feed and breed.",

Males sing through the early part of the nesting season, even at midday, sometimes from the tops of bushes and small trees but often from concealed perches in scrubby vegetation. Thick, scrubby habitat with scattered oaks and plenty of dense underbrush made up of shorter shrubs and small trees.  Male Black-capped Vireos have a striking jet-black cap that covers their crown, malar region, and upperparts. This black cap sharply contrasts with their striking white spectacles, giving them a distinct and iconic appearance. The spectacles encompass the area around their eyes, creating an effect that almost appears like a pair of elegant and well-defined eyebrows. This feature, combined with their coal-black throat, further enhances their striking facial markings.",

The flanks and under the tail have a green-yellow wash. Adults have red eyes that appear dark from a distance; immatures have dark eyes. They forage in deciduous canopies where they can be difficult to find among the green leaves. They move slowly and methodically, carefully scanning leaves above and below for their favored caterpillar prey. However, their habit of near-incessant singing in summer, even in the heat of midafternoon, helps draw attention to them. Large expanses of deciduous forest, particularly deciduous trees with large leaves (such as maples), typify Red-eyed Vireo habitat during the breeding season. On migration, look for them in nearly any type of forest, woodland, or woodlot (particularly in deciduous stands). It is often the commonest of vireo migrants. ",

They have a dark line through the eye and a white line over the eye. The lores (the area between the eye and bill) are white in most individuals. Typically, the brightest plumage on Warbling Vireos is on vent or flanks. Worn midsummer birds can be nearly entirely gray above and whitish below. Warbling Vireos forage sluggishly, intently peering at leaf surfaces from a single perch before pouncing or moving on. They eat mostly caterpillars. They give their loud, rollicking, finch-like song frequently on summer territories. Deciduous forest is the favored habitat of Warbling Vireos throughout the year, though they also use some mixed coniferous and deciduous habitats. Even on migration they typically occur in areas with taller trees. Western birds tend to be a bit drabber than eastern birds, though plumage color varies more with season than from east to west. Western birds also have slightly longer bills, but this difference is only rarely useable in the field. The two forms have similar, but diagnosably different songs, western birds having higher-pitched, less \u201csing-songy,\u201d less caroling, and slightly longer songs than those of eastern birds. The two forms meet near the western edge of the Great Plains, and both forms breed in, at least, Colorado. ",
    "157.Yellow_throated_Vireo": "The Yellow-throated Vireo is a small and vibrant bird species that belongs to the Vireonidae family.  It exhibits distinct physical attributes, behavior patterns, and habitat preferences that make it easily distinguishable among other avian species. \n\nIn terms of physical appearance, the Yellow-throated Vireo showcases a unique combination of colors that contribute to its striking beauty.  The bird possesses a primarily olive-green plumage on its upperparts, which blends perfectly with the surrounding foliage, enabling it to camouflage effectively.  Its head, however, exhibits a bright yellow coloration on the throat, chin, and upper breast, providing a vivid contrast against the green.  This splash of yellow acts as a key identifying feature and gives the species its name. Its body shape is cylindrical with a sturdy beak suited for its insectivorous diet.    Apart from its attractive coloration, the Yellow-throated Vireo possesses a distinctive facial pattern.  It features a white supercilium, or eyebrow, above its eye, which is bordered with a black stripe.

Winter birds are paler brown, with bright yellow rump and usually some yellow on the sides. Yellow-rumped Warblers typically forage in the outer tree canopies at middle heights. They're active, and you'll often see them sally out to catch insects in midair, sometimes on long flights. In winter they spend lots of time eating berries from shrubs, and they often travel in large flocks. In summer, Yellow-rumped Warblers are birds of open coniferous forests and edges, and to a lesser extent deciduous forests. In fall and winter they move to open woods and shrubby habitats, including coastal vegetation, parks, and residential areas. The Yellow-rumped Warbler has two distinct subspecies that used to be considered separate species: the Myrtle Warbler of the eastern U.S. and Canada's boreal forest, and Audubon\u2019s Warbler of the mountainous West. The Audubon\u2019s has a yellow throat; in the Myrtle subspecies the throat is white. Male Audubon's Warblers have more white in the wing than the Myrtle Warbler. Female Audubon's have less distinctly marked faces, lacking the dark ear patches of the Myrtle Warbler.

They have a thin white or yellow stripe over the eye, a blackish line through the eye, and a pale partial eyering. The namesake orange crown patch is rarely seen, but may become visible when the bird raises its head feathers in excitement or agitation. The undertail coverts are bright yellow and are often the brightest part of the plumage. Orange-crowned Warblers forage in dense shrubbery and low trees. They tend to be quiet and unobtrusive, although their low foraging habits can help you spot them. They often give a high, faint contact call while foraging. Orange-crowned Warblers breed in dense areas of deciduous shrubs, usually within or adjacent to forest. They can occur from low-elevation oak scrub to stunted forest near timberline. During migration you may find them in nearly any habitat, though they still show a preference for dense, low vegetation. Orange-crowned Warblers of the Pacific slope are quite bright, even yellowish, and can be readily confused with Yellow Warblers (see Similar Species). The stripe over the eye (superciliary) is always yellow, as are their underparts, and the blurry olive streaks contrast more strongly than in other forms of the species. In the Interior West, Orange-crowned Warblers usually have gray heads. Though some may have yellow-green heads, they still usually contrast fairly obviously with a brighter olive back. These birds may have white or yellow superciliaries. The largest subspecies, sordida, occurs only on the Channel Islands of California. ",

This is one bird where behavior\u2014this bird\u2019s near-constant tail-wagging\u2014can help confirm its identity. They mainly forage on open ground or in low vegetation, rather than in forest canopy as many warblers do (although they do sing from high perches in trees and shrubs). During migration and winter Palm Warblers use weedy fields, forest edges, fence rows, and other areas with scattered trees and shrubs. They breed in the boreal forest of the far north, where they use bogs with scattered evergreen trees and thick ground cover. Plumage of Palm Warblers is different on either side of James Bay which lies between Ontario and Quebec in Canada. Palm Warblers east of James Bay (\u201cYellow\u201d Palm Warblers) have entirely yellow underparts with stronger rusty streaks on the breast and yellow eyebrows. Those west of James Bay (\u201cWestern\u201d Palm Warblers) have whitish bellies, yellow undertails, and pale eyebrows.

Larger than a Golden-crowned Kinglet, slightly smaller than a Yellow-rumped Warbler. sparrow-sized or smaller. Both Sexes. Length: 3.9-5.1 in (10-13 cm). Weight: 0.3-0.3 oz (8-10 g). Wingspan: 7.5-7.9 in (19-20 cm). Breeding males have a gray head with a white line over the eye, contrasting with a green back and no wingbars. The underparts are whitish all the way through the undertail coverts. Females and nonbreeding males are more greenish, with less contrast between head and back. Occasionally very olive-yellow all over except for white undertail coverts. Tennessee Warblers forage on slender branches high in the forest canopy, feeding primarily on insects. On their breeding grounds a primary food is a small caterpillar called spruce budworm. Tennessee Warblers breed in coniferous or mixed deciduous-coniferous forest across Canada. On migration they can occur in most types of forests and woodlands. Winters in second-growth tropical forests.  As for its coloration, the Tennessee Warbler exhibits a striking combination of vibrant hues. The breeding plumage, donned by males during the mating season, displays a dazzling mix of greenish-yellow on the upperparts, creating a bright and eye-catching visual appearance. This is complemented by their pale gray undersides, including the throat and breast, giving a subtle contrast to the overall plumage.",
    "181.Worm_eating_Warbler": "A small songbird, shaped like many other warblers but with a rather long, spikelike bill and moderately long wings and tail. Larger than a Ruby-crowned Kinglet, smaller than a Song Sparrow. sparrow-sized or smaller. Both Sexes. Length: 4.4-5.2 in (11.2-13.1 cm). Weight: 0.4-0.5 oz (12-14 g). Wingspan: 7.9-8.7 in (20-22 cm). Brownish olive above with rich buff head and underparts, a black eyeline and crown stripes, and pinkish legs. Worm-eating Warblers hunt insects in dense understory foliage, especially in clusters of dead leaves and vine tangles. Males sing an insectlike trill that is easily confused with the song of Chipping Sparrow. The species is territorial in nesting and wintering sites but occasionally joins mixed-species flocks in winter. Breeding birds use woodland habitats with dense understory, especially on slopes in the northern part of their breeding range. Migrants and wintering birds are found in many habitat types, from mangroves to mountain forests.  The Worm-eating Warbler measures about 12 centimeters in length, making it roughly the size of a sparrow. It has a slender build with a relatively short tail and a slightly decurved bill. The bird's overall appearance is characterized by a dynamic combination of colors and patterns, allowing for easy recognition in the wild. The upperparts of the Worm-eating Warbler are primarily olive-brown, while the underparts are a lighter shade of cream or pale yellow. These colors provide excellent camouflage against the forest vegetation where this species is often found. However, it is often the distinct patterns that truly set this warbler apart.",
    "182.Yellow_Warbler": "Yellow Warblers are small, evenly proportioned songbirds with medium-length tails and rounded heads. For a warbler, the straight, thin bill is relatively large. About the same size as a Yellow-rumped Warbler; slightly larger than an American Goldfinch. sparrow-sized or smaller. Both Sexes. Length: 4.7-5.1 in (12-13 cm). Weight: 0.3-0.4 oz (9-11 g). Wingspan: 6.3-7.9 in (16-20 cm). Yellow Warblers are uniformly yellow birds. Males are a bright, egg-yolk yellow with reddish streaks on the underparts. Both sexes flash yellow patches in the tail. The face is unmarked, accentuating the large black eye. Look for Yellow Warblers near the tops of tall shrubs and small trees. They forage restlessly, with quick hops along small branches and twigs to glean caterpillars and other insects. Males sing their sweet, whistled songs from high perches. Yellow Warblers breed in shrubby thickets and woods, particularly along watercourses and in wetlands. Common trees include willows, alders, and cottonwoods across North America and up to about 9,000 feet in the West. In winter they mainly occur in mangrove forests of Central and South America. Yellow Warblers differ only slightly across continental North America. Various subspecies that live year-round in the Caribbean and in mangrove forests of Central and South America have bright chestnut on the crown or over the entire head; these subspecies are often referred to as \u201cGolden\u201d or \u201cMangrove\u201d Yellow Warblers. There is a very small population of \u201cMangrove\u201d Yellow Warblers in extreme south Texas. ",
    "184.Louisiana_Waterthrush": "A large, somewhat plump warbler, with a stout bill (bigger than Northern Waterthrush\u2019s), rather short tail, and long legs.

The supercilium is thicker in Louisiana than in \u200bNorthern, and tends to flare at the rear. The legs are bright pink. Louisiana Waterthrushes perch and forage in vegetation, on the ground, or at the water\u2019s edge. They methodically bob their rear ends as they forage. Males sing mostly from low vegetation, often from a concealed perch. Louisiana Waterthrushes are almost always seen near fast-flowing forested streams or creeks. On migration they sometimes use the edges of lakes and ponds if there is adequate vegetative cover.  Appearance:\nThe Louisiana Waterthrush measures between 5.5 to 6.5 inches (14-16.5 centimeters) in length and has a wingspan of 9 to 11 inches (23-28 cm). Its body structure is slender and elongated, reminiscent of other thrush species. Males and females are quite similar in appearance. The upperparts of the bird are predominantly olive-brown in color with darker streaks, while the underparts are lighter and show creamy or buff tones. Distinctive Features:\nOne of the Louisiana Waterthrush's most striking features is its bold white eyestripe, which extends from the base of the bill to the back of the head. This eyestripe is particularly prominent against its olive-brown face and ear coverts. Another distinguishing feature is the bird's long, pink legs, which are perfectly adapted for its preferred habitat and foraging behavior. It also possesses a long, pointed bill, aiding in capturing its aquatic prey. ",
    "188.Pileated_Woodpecker": "The Pileated Woodpecker is a very large woodpecker with a long neck and a triangular crest that sweeps off the back of the head. The bill is long and chisel-like, about the length of the head. In flight, the wings are broad and the bird can seem crowlike. Nearly the size of an American Crow. crow-sized. Both Sexes. Length: 15.8-19.3 in (40-49 cm). Weight: 8.8-12.3 oz (250-350 g). Wingspan: 26.0-29.5 in (66-75 cm). Pileated Woodpeckers are mostly black with white stripes on the face and neck and a flaming-red crest. Males have a red stripe on the cheek. In flight, the bird reveals extensive white underwings and small white crescents on the upper side, at the bases of the primaries. Pileated Woodpeckers drill distinctive rectangular-shaped holes in rotten wood to get at carpenter ants and other insects. They are loud birds with whinnying calls. They also drum on dead trees in a deep, slow, rolling pattern, and even the heavy chopping sound of foraging carries well. Their flight undulates like other woodpeckers, which helps separate them from a crow\u2019s straight flight path. Pileated Woodpeckers are forest birds that require large, standing dead trees and downed wood. Forests can be evergreen, deciduous, or mixed and are often old, particularly in the West. In the East they live in young forests as well and may even be seen in partially wooded suburbs and backyards. ",
    "189.Red_bellied_Woodpecker": "A sleek, round-headed woodpecker, about the same size as a Hairy Woodpecker but without the blocky outlines. Same size as Hairy Woodpecker; three-quarters the size of a Northern Flicker. between robin and crow. Both Sexes. Length: 9.4 in (24 cm). Weight: 2.0-3.2 oz (56-91 g). Wingspan: 13.0-16.5 in (33-42 cm). Often appears pale overall, even the boldly black-and-white striped back, with flashing red cap and nape. Look for white patches near the wingtips as this bird flies. Look for Red-bellied Woodpeckers hitching along branches and trunks of medium to large trees, picking at the bark surface more often than drilling into it. Like most woodpeckers, these birds have a characteristic undulating flight pattern. Red-bellied Woodpeckers are common in many Eastern woodlands and forests, from old stands of oak and hickory to young hardwoods and pines. They will also often venture from forests to appear at backyard feeders.  To provide a comprehensive visual definition of the Red-bellied Woodpecker, let's begin with its overall size and shape. Adult Red-bellied Woodpeckers typically measure around 9-10 inches (23-25 cm) in length, with a wingspan of approximately 13-16 inches (33-41 cm). Their body shape is robust and compact, exhibiting a typical woodpecker build. The head is relatively large, displaying a chisel-like bill, which is long, pointed, and designed for wood-drilling. One of the most striking visual features of the Red-bellied Woodpecker is its colorful plumage. Contrary to its name, the belly of this woodpecker is not predominantly red, but rather displays a pale creamy or buff-colored patch. The back and wings of the bird are dominated by intricate black and white patterns, creating a prominent zebra-like effect. The upperparts are covered in black feathers, while the lower back and outer wings exhibit white barred patterns.",
    "190.Red_cockaded_Woodpecker": "Red-cockaded Woodpeckers are small woodpeckers with short, straight bills. robin-sized. Both Sexes. Length: 7.9-9.1 in (20-23 cm). Weight: 1.5-1.8 oz (42-52 g). Wingspan: 14.2 in (36 cm). Despite their name, they are largely black and white, with a large, bright-white cheek patch and a bold black malar stripe forming the lower border of the cheek. Males have a tiny, nearly invisible red streak (\u201ccockade\u201d) at the upper border of the cheek. The back has strong horizontal black-and-white bars. Red-cockaded Woodpeckers live in family groups and cooperate to raise young. They often forage in small groups and can be quite vocal. They excavate nest and roost cavities in living pine trees, pecking holes in the bark to keep a flow of sticky pitch around the nest cavity. This endangered species is a habitat specialist that is strongly tied to old-growth pine forests that burn frequently, leaving the understory mostly clear of younger pines and hardwoods. They were once common in vast tracts of longleaf pine; now they also occur in loblolly, slash, and some other pine stands in the southeastern pine flatwoods.  Despite its name, the \"red cockade\" that characterizes this woodpecker is not immediately apparent. Males have a small patch of red feathers, known as a cockade, on the side of their head, but it is usually not visible unless the bird is handled or aggressive interactions occur. These red \"cockades\" are absent in females, making them slightly more difficult to differentiate visually.",
    "191.Red_headed_Woodpecker": "Red-headed Woodpeckers are medium-sized woodpeckers with fairly large, rounded heads, short, stiff tails, and powerful, spike-like bills. Smaller than a Northern Flicker; about the size of a Hairy Woodpecker. between robin and crow. Both Sexes. Length: 7.5-9.1 in (19-23 cm). Weight: 2.0-3.2 oz (56-91 g). Wingspan: 16.5 in (42 cm). Adults have bright-red heads, white underparts, and black backs with large white patches in the wings, making the lower back appear all white when perched. Immatures have gray-brown heads, and the white wing patches show rows of black spots near the trailing edge. In addition to catching insects by the normal woodpecker method of hammering at wood, Red-headed Woodpeckers also catch insects in flight and hunt for them on the ground. They also eat considerable amounts of fruit and seeds. Their raspy calls are shriller and scratchier than the Red-bellied Woodpecker\u2019s. Red-headed Woodpeckers live in pine savannahs and other open forests with clear understories. Open pine plantations, treerows in agricultural areas, and standing timber in beaver swamps and other wetlands all attract Red-headed Woodpeckers.  This woodpecker species displays a remarkable combination of contrasting colors. As the name suggests, the Red-headed Woodpecker exhibits a vivid crimson-red head, extending from the prominent forehead to the nape, and perfectly contrasted against the bird's jet-black wings, back, and tail. The rest of its plumage is predominantly white, creating a striking contrast against its robust red head. This striking coloration helps in easy identification and sets it apart from other woodpecker species.",
    "192.Downy_Woodpecker": "Downy Woodpeckers are small versions of the classic woodpecker body plan. They have a straight, chisel-like bill, blocky head, wide shoulders, and straight-backed posture as they lean away from tree limbs and onto their tail feathers. The bill tends to look smaller for the bird\u2019s size than in other woodpeckers. About two-thirds the size of a Hairy Woodpecker. between sparrow and robin. Both Sexes. Length: 5.5-6.7 in (14-17 cm). Weight: 0.7-1.0 oz (21-28 g). Wingspan: 9.8-11.8 in (25-30 cm). Downy Woodpeckers give a checkered black-and-white impression. The black upperparts are checked with white on the wings, the head is boldly striped, and the back has a broad white stripe down the center. Males have a small red patch on the back of the head. The outer tail feathers are typically white with a few black spots. Downy Woodpeckers hitch around tree limbs and trunks or drop into tall weeds to feed on galls, moving more acrobatically than larger woodpeckers. Their rising-and-falling flight style is distinctive of many woodpeckers. In spring and summer, Downy Woodpeckers make lots of noise, both with their shrill whinnying call and by drumming on trees. You\u2019ll find Downy Woodpeckers in open woodlands, particularly among deciduous trees, and brushy or weedy edges. They\u2019re also at home in orchards, city parks, backyards and vacant lots. Downy Woodpeckers in the West are darker overall, and they tend to have less white in the wings than birds from eastern North America. Pacific Northwest have a dusky wash overall. ",

Smaller than a House Sparrow; slightly larger than a House Wren. sparrow-sized or smaller. Both Sexes. Bewick\u2019s Wrens are subdued brown-and-gray wrens with a long, brow-like white stripe over the eye. The back and wings are plain brown; underparts gray-white; and the long tail is barred with black and tipped with white spots. Males and females look the same. Bewick\u2019s Wrens cock their long tails up over their backs, often flicking their tails from side to side or fanning them as they skulk through tangles of branches and leaves searching for insects. During breeding season, males sing vigorously from prominent perches. Bewick\u2019s Wrens favor dry brushy areas, chaparral, scrub, thickets in open country, and open woodlands near rivers and streams. They are at home in gardens, residential areas, and parks in cities and suburbs.  The Bewick's Wren is a small passerine bird, measuring approximately 12 centimeters in length. It possesses a slender body with a long, slightly curved beak. The beak is dark grey or blackish in color and specifically adapted for its omnivorous diet, which primarily consists of invertebrates, insects, spiders, and small fruits. Its wings, tail, and body are a warm and rich brown, blending into a uniform coloration. One of the most distinctive features of the Bewick's Wren is its intriguing patterns, specifically the bold and intricate markings on its back and wings. The upperparts showcase a series of dark brown barring and mottling against a lighter brown background, forming a unique pattern that aids in camouflage among foliage. Additionally, the wings exhibit beautiful, fine white spotting, creating a striking contrast against the browns, giving the impression of tiny snowflakes sprinkled along its feathers.",

The Cactus Wren is the largest wren in the United States and is similar in size to a Spotted Towhee. Larger than a Bewick\u2019s Wren, smaller than a Northern Mockingbird. between sparrow and robin. Both Sexes. The Cactus Wren is a speckled brown bird with bright white eyebrows that extend from the bill, across and above their red eyes, to the sides of the neck. They have pale cinnamon sides and a white chest with dark speckles. The back is brown with heavy white streaks, and the tail is barred white and black\u2014especially noticeable from below. Males and females look alike, but juveniles are slightly paler and have a brown eye. Unlike other wrens that typically hide in vegetation, the Cactus Wren seems to have no fear. They perch atop cacti and other shrubs to announce their presence and forage out in the open. They do not cock their tails over their back the way other wrens do. Instead they fan their tail feathers, flashing white tail tips. Bewick\u2019s Wrens favor dry brushy areas, chaparral, scrub, thickets in open country, and open woodlands near rivers and streams. They are at home in gardens, residential areas, and parks in cities and suburbs. ",
    "195.Carolina_Wren": "The Carolina Wren is a small but chunky bird with a round body and a long tail that it often cocks upward.

Both Sexes. Length: 4.7-5.5 in (12-14 cm). Weight: 0.6-0.8 oz (18-22 g). Wingspan: 11.4 in (29 cm). Both males and females are a bright, unpatterned reddish-brown above and warm buffy-orange below, with a long white eyebrow stripe, dark bill, and white chin and throat. The Carolina Wren creeps around vegetated areas and scoots up and down tree trunks in search of insects and fruit. It explores yards, garages, and woodpiles, sometimes nesting there. This wren often cocks its tail upward while foraging and holds it down when singing. Carolina Wrens defend their territories with constant singing; they aggressively scold and chase off intruders. Look\u2014or listen\u2014for Carolina Wrens singing or calling from dense vegetation in wooded areas, especially in forest ravines and neighborhoods. These birds love to move low through tangled understory; they frequent backyard brush piles and areas choked with vines and bushes. The Florida population of Carolina Wrens is larger and stouter, a darker rusty chestnut above and more deeply colored below. ",
    "196.House_Wren": "Small and compact, with a flat head and fairly long, curved beak. Short-winged, often keeping its longish tail either cocked above the line of the body or slightly drooped.

Subdued brown overall with darker barring on the wings and tail. The pale eyebrow that is characteristic of so many wren species is much fainter in House Wrens. Bubbly and energetic, just like their songs. Look for House Wrens hopping quickly through tangles and low branches and, in spring and summer, frequently pausing to deliver cheerful trilling songs. In summer, House Wrens are at home in open forests, forest edges, and areas with scattered grass and trees. Backyards, farmyards, and city parks are perfect for them. In winter they become more secretive, preferring brushy tangles, thickets, and hedgerows. A brown-throated subspecies of the House Wren occurs in mountains of extreme southeastern Arizona. It has a distinct buffy eyebrow and cinnamon-buff throat and chest. House Wrens occur all the way through the Americas to southern Argentina. Individuals in the Caribbean and South America tend to be warmer colored and have somewhat different voices. ",

Brown wings have fine, dark barring and there are small speckles on the back and wings. The russet tail has dark bars and a buffy tip. A wren of dry, stony environments, Rock Wrens forage by hopping along the ground and investigating crevices for insects and spiders, which they extract with their fine bills. When agitated, they frequently call as they bob up and down. Rock Wrens occupy almost any arid, stony environment, from desert to alpine, provided there is not too much vegetation. They avoid wetlands and waterways but use habitats altered by industrial activity (mining, clearcutting, road building, etc.).  One of the most distinctive features of the Rock Wren is its long, slightly curved beak. The beak is dark, often blackish or gray, and perfectly suited for capturing insects, their primary source of food. Their robust beak, combined with a slightly down-turned angle, allows them to pry apart cracks and crevices in rocky terrain to obtain their prey.",
    "199.Winter_Wren": "The Winter Wren is a plump round ball with a stubby tail that it usually holds straight up. Its bill is small and thin, in keeping with its diminutive appearance.

Wingspan: 4.7-6.3 in (12-16 cm). In the dark forest understory, the Winter Wren appears brown overall. With a closer look, you\u2019ll see darker brown barring on the wings, tail, and belly. It has a pale tan eyebrow stripe above the eye and a plain brown cap. Its unmarked throat and barred belly are pale tan, paler than the back. Winter Wrens hop and scamper through the understory moving more like a mouse than a bird as they investigate upturned roots and decaying logs for food. These energetic birds often bob their entire bodies as if doing squats while they nervously look around in the forest understory. In flight they rapidly beat their tiny wings to move short distances between cover. Winter Wrens use both deciduous and evergreen forests with plenty of downed logs, standing dead trees, larger trees, and understory vegetation. They are often more common in areas near streams. ",
    "200.Common_Yellowthroat": "Common Yellowthroats are small songbirds with chunky, rounded heads and medium-length, slightly rounded tails.

Wingspan: 5.9-7.5 in (15-19 cm). Adult males are bright yellow below, with a sharp black face mask and olive upperparts. A thin whitish line sets off the black mask from the head and neck. Immature males show traces of the full mask of adult males. Females are a plain olive brown, usually with yellow brightening the throat and under the tail. They lack the black mask. Common Yellowthroats spend much of their time skulking low to the ground in dense thickets and fields, searching for small insects and spiders. Males sing a very distinctive, rolling wichety-wichety-wichety song, and both sexes give a full-sounding chuck note that is easy to learn. During migration, this is often the most common warbler found in fields and edges. It sometimes joins other warbler species in mixed foraging flocks. Yellowthroats live in open areas with thick, low vegetation, ranging from marsh to grassland to open pine forest. During migration, they use an even broader suite of habitats including backyards and forest. ",

Wingspan: 76.0-85.0 in (193-216 cm). Dark brown overall, sometimes with whitish plumage in uppertail and undertail coverts or on the face. Feet and bill blackish. Albatrosses have a very distinctive flight style known as dynamic soaring. They rarely flap their wings except in very light winds. They typically fly low to the water, sometimes down in the wave troughs, and then swoop up into the sky, catch the wind, and accelerate downwind before swooping low to the water again. Often forages in groups, sometimes mixed with other seabirds and marine mammals. Nests on low, sandy islands in the tropical North Pacific. Forages both near to shore (though usually not within sight of land) and far offshore, in places where upwelling or converging currents concentrate nutrients and prey at the sea surface.  In terms of size, the Black-footed Albatross is a large bird, comparable to a small to medium-sized dog. On average, it measures around 30 to 32 inches (76 to 81 centimeters) in length, from the tip of its beak to the end of its tail. However, what truly sets this species apart is its exceptionally long wingspan, which can reach an impressive span of approximately 78 to 86 inches (198 to 218 centimeters).

The feathers of the upperparts can show some purple or green gloss in optimal light. Forages by hopping along on the ground or climbing clumsily through low vegetation. Looks for insects and small vertebrates, especially lizards, and pounces on them with the large bill.   Usually seen in groups. Dense, low vegetation such as shrubs or small trees in arid, open country of lowlands. Nonbreeding birds sometimes move temporarily into wetter habitats such as marshes, especially during droughts. The Groove-billed Ani showcases an intriguing blend of colors and distinctive physical features that make it easily distinguishable from other avian species.    Their body shape is slender yet sturdy, with an elongated tail that contributes to their unmistakable silhouette.    This bird's plumage is predominantly dark overall, featuring shades of glossy black that glisten beautifully under the sunlight.  However, upon closer examination, its body presents subtle hues of brown and gray, adding depth and intricacy to its appearance.  The plumage often appears rather smooth, with a sleek and slightly iridescent sheen.    The most striking feature of the Groove-billed Ani is its beak, which stands out prominently against its dark plumage.  The bill is relatively long, slightly decurved, and exhibits deep grooves or ridges along its upper and lower mandibles, giving the species its name.",
    "006.Least_Auklet": "An abundant tiny auklet, only slightly larger than a sparrow. Occurs in large colonies around rocky shores during summer, and in smaller flocks further from the coast during winter. Summer plumage appears messy with numerous gray spots around the belly. Winter plumage is more contrastingly marked with flashing white belly and shoulders. Gives frequent, consistent squawks and squeaks at colonies. Readily separable from other auklets due to its whiter plumage and smaller size. The Least Auklet is the tiniest member of the auk family, no bigger than a sparrow. They are abundant around islands in the Bering Sea, where scores at a time can be seen perched on rock piles above the beach, chirping and chirring. They are sometimes in huge flocks, winging low over the waves on very rapid beats of their small wings, or circling in the air near nesting colonies. Least Auklets are oddly variable in the pattern of their underparts, which can be anything from white to spotted to solid dark gray .  Measuring merely 15 centimeters in length, the Least Auklet is one of the smallest auklets in the world. Its small yet sturdy build gives it a spherical appearance, with a short neck and a plump body. In terms of coloration, the bird sports a predominantly dark plumage, appearing primarily black or grayish-black. However, upon closer examination, one can observe beautiful flecks of white on its abdomen and undertail coverts, creating an enchanting contrast. The plumage exhibits an immaculately clean appearance, with feathers neatly aligned, showcasing the bird's overall elegance. One of the distinctive visual characteristics of the Least Auklet is its facial features. The bird boasts a petite, triangular, and pale grayish-colored bill. This unique beak serves multiple purposes, ranging from feeding to communication within the species. The eyes of the Least Auklet are relatively small, yet they project a sense of keenness. These dark, twinkling eyes are bordered by a thin, white eyering, further enhancing the bird's striking appearance.",

Females are basically brown, with faint streaking on the breast, a whitish throat, and sometimes a touch of blue on the wings, tail, or rump. Immature males are patchy blue and brown. Male Indigo Buntings sing from treetops, shrubs, and telephone lines all summer. This species eats insects, seeds, and berries, and can be attracted to backyards with thistle or nyjer seed. While perching, they often swish their tails from side to side. Fairly solitary during breeding season, Indigo Buntings form large flocks during migration and on their wintering grounds. Look for Indigo Buntings in weedy and brushy areas, especially where fields meet forests. They love edges, hedgerows, overgrown patches, and brushy roadsides. When not singing from the tallest perches in the area, they can often be seen foraging among seed-laden shrubs and grasses. ",

Its overall shape is reminiscent of a small falcon or hawk, characterized by a long, slightly curved beak, a short squared-off tail, and long, pointed wings. The plumage of the Black-billed Cuckoo is predominantly brownish-gray, offering excellent camouflage within the dappled light of the forest.  They have a mottled appearance, with a dark brown crown and rufous-colored outer feathers on their tails.  The undertail coverts are boldly barred with black and white, adding an interesting contrast to its overall appearance.  The plumage is fairly uniform, lacking any vivid or distinctive patterns.  One of the most notable features of the Black-billed Cuckoo is, as the name suggests, its black bill.  The bill is slightly decurved and somewhat slender, perfectly adapted for capturing prey.  The eyes of this cuckoo are a striking red, creating a beautiful contrast against the muted tones of its plumage.  These bright red eyes are often a key characteristic used to identify the species.

In winter, often forages in flocks mixed with other rosy-finch species, which fly up in whirls from feeding areas and roadsides. Nests high on mountains, in boulder fields and cliffs, and forages on scree slopes, ice fields, glaciers, meadows, and avalanche areas. Descends to open areas in lower elevations in winter, sometimes into forests and towns, especially where there are feeders. Ornithologists recognize six subspecies, three that have mostly grayish faces, three that have gray in the crown but brownish cheeks. Two of the gray-headed subspecies\u2014griseonucha and umbrina\u2014live on the Aleutian and the Pribilof Islands, respectively. These are both very large subspecies, weighing twice as much as the continental subspecies. The other gray-headed subspecies, the small littoralis, is often called \u201cHepburn\u2019s\u201d Rosy-Finch. It nests from mainland Alaska south to California.

With a closer look you\u2019ll see the brown plumage is richly patterned with black spots, bars, and crescents. Northern Flickers spend lots of time on the ground, and when in trees they\u2019re often perched upright on horizontal branches instead of leaning against their tails on a trunk. They fly in an up-and-down path using heavy flaps interspersed with glides, like many woodpeckers. Look for flickers in open habitats near trees, including woodlands, edges, yards, and parks. In the West you can find them in mountain forests all the way up to treeline. North America has two easily distinguished races of Northern Flickers: the yellow-shafted form of the East, which occurs into Texas and the Great Plains, and the red-shafted form of the West. The key difference is the color of the flight-feather shafts, which are either a lemon yellow or a rosy red. Yellow-shafted forms have tan faces and gray crowns, and a red crescent on the nape. Males have a black mustache stripe. Red-shafted forms have a gray face, brown crown, and no nape crescent, with males showing a red mustache stripe.

The adult has a bright blue back, wings and tail.  Its head, shoulders, flanks and lower belly are chestnut, and the throat and breast are white.  The large bill and legs are bright red.  The flight of the white-throated kingfisher is rapid and direct, the short rounded wings whirring.  In flight, large white patches are visible on the blue and black wings.  Sexes are similar, but juveniles are a duller version of the adult.  They vary clinally in size, the shades of blue on the mantle which is more greenish in smyrnensis and fusca and more blue or purplish in saturatior.  H. s. gularis of the Philippines has only the neck and throat white.  Race fusca is found in Peninsular India and Sri Lanka and is slightly smaller, bluer and with a darker brown underside than the nominate race found in northwestern India.  Race saturatior is found in the Andaman Islands and is larger with darker brown underparts.  Its body is compact and sturdy, with a short tail and a relatively large head.  The plumage of this nuthatch is predominantly bluish-gray on its upperparts, including the wings and back.  However, its most defining feature is the striking white underparts, which extend from its throat to its belly.  This stark contrast between the bluish-gray upperparts and white underparts makes the White-breasted Nuthatch easily recognizable.  Another noteworthy physical characteristic is the black cap that adorns its head.  This cap extends from the forehead to the nape, sharply contrasting with the bird's white face.

Apart from the distinguishing feature implicit in its name, it is very similar to its better known relative, the black-legged kittiwake;    other differences include the shorter bill, larger eyes, a larger, rounder head and darker grey wings, and in the juveniles, which barely differ from the adults, lacking the black tail band and W across the wings of juvenile black-legged kittiwakes.    Juveniles take three years to reach maturity.    Like the Pacific race of black-legged kittiwake, the red-legged kittiwake has a well-developed hind toe.    The Red-legged Kittiwake is a distinctive seabird species belonging to the gull family Laridae.    This elegant bird is characterized by its specific physical attributes, striking coloration, and unique habitat preferences.    Let us delve into the detailed visual definition of the Red-legged Kittiwake.    \n\nStarting with its shape, the Red-legged Kittiwake possesses a compact, agile body that is well-adapted for its marine lifestyle.    It has a medium-sized build, slightly smaller than most other gull species.    The bird measures approximately 38-41 centimeters in length, with a wingspan of around 84-92 centimeters.    Its body structure is designed for swift, graceful flight and precise maneuverability over the ocean's surface.    The plumage of the Red-legged Kittiwake is truly captivating.    Adults exhibit a predominantly clean, snow-white coloring on their body, head, and underparts.    This pristine white plumage contrasts beautifully with various other features.   These dark wingtips are a signature trait of the species and provide a distinguishable visual characteristic, especially in flight.    These vibrant red limbs stand out vividly against its otherwise monochromatic appearance.    The contrasting red legs, combined with the dark wingtips and white plumage, offer a stunning visual spectacle.    the Red-legged Kittiwake, with its compact yet agile body, stunning white plumage, contrasting black wingtips, and vibrant red legs, is a visually captivating seabird.",

Males proudly display a bright and bold reddish-orange patch, which instantly captures attention. This striking feature is one of the species' trademark qualities.",
    "165.Chestnut_sided_Warbler": "An slim warbler with a relatively long tail that it often holds cocked, or raised above the body line, which makes the tail appear longer still. Larger than a Ruby-crowned Kinglet, smaller than a Song Sparrow. sparrow-sized or smaller. Both Sexes. Length: 4.7-5.5 in (12-14 cm). Weight: 0.4-0.5 oz (10.7-14.3 g). Wingspan: 7.5-8.3 in (19-21 cm). Breeding adults are crisp gray-and-white birds with a yellow crown, black face markings, and rich chestnut flanks. Males are more richly marked than females. In nonbreeding plumage, adults and immatures are bright lime-green above with a neat white eyering, two wingbars, and pale gray to white underparts. Chestnut-sided Warblers flit and hop along slender branches, carefully inspecting the undersides of deciduous leaves. Look for them in saplings and shrubs more often than in tall trees. They often raise the tail and droop the wings as they move through the branches. They nest in young deciduous regrowth and other thickets, where small trees and shrubs have been regenerating for a few years after a disturbance such as logging or wind storm. They are also found in stunted highland oak forest at the southern end of their breeding range. Migrating and wintering birds are found in a great variety of brushy, successional, and mature forested environments. ",
    "166.Golden_winged_Warbler": "Golden-winged Warblers are small songbirds with fairly slim bodies and short tails. They have a thin, straight bill that is sharply pointed. Slightly smaller than a Black-capped Chickadee. sparrow-sized or smaller. Both Sexes. Adult males are silvery gray with a strong black-and-white face pattern, yellow crown, and large yellow patches on the wings. Females are similar but lack the male\u2019s black mask and bib. Hybrids with the Blue-winged Warbler can produce a mostly light gray form (\u201cBrewster\u2019s\u201d) or a mostly golden form (\u201cLawrence\u2019s\u201d). Golden-winged Warblers forage among the leaves and branch tips of their low, shrubby habitat. Males sing their loud, buzzy song over and over again from the tops of shrubs during early summer. Golden-winged Warblers breed in tangled, shrubby habitats such as regenerating clearcuts, wet thickets, and tamarack bogs. They often move into nearby woodland when the young have fledged. They spend winters in open woodlands and shade-coffee plantations of Central and South America.  This warbler measures approximately 4.5-5 inches (11-13 cm) in length, making it a compact bird. Its overall shape is slender and slightly elongated, with a relatively short tail. The wings are relatively broad for its size, showcasing the characteristic golden-yellow coloration that gives the species its name. The golden tone, typically found on the secondary coverts, contrasts beautifully against the surrounding black feathers, creating a striking visual effect. The plumage of the Golden-winged Warbler is sexually dimorphic, meaning that males and females exhibit different color patterns. Male birds are adorned with vibrant and eye-catching plumage, whereas females have a more subdued appearance. Males display a black crown and face, extending down their throat and nape. Their cheeks and ear area are often tinged with a crisp white color, contributing to their distinctive markings.",
    "180.Wilson_Warbler": "Wilson\u2019s Warblers are one of our smallest warblers. They have long, thin tails and small, thin bills. They appear rather round bodied and large headed for their size. Larger than a Ruby-crowned Kinglet, smaller than a Common Yellowthroat. sparrow-sized or smaller. Both Sexes. Length: 3.9-4.7 in (10-12 cm). Weight: 0.2-0.3 oz (5-10 g). Wingspan: 5.5-6.7 in (14-17 cm). Wilson\u2019s Warblers are bright yellow below and yellowish olive above. Their black eyes stand out on their yellow cheeks. Males have a distinctive black cap. Adult females are similar in color but show variations in the amount of black on the top of the head, from a few blackish feathers to a small dark cap. Juvenile females have an olive crown and a yellow eyebrow. Wilson\u2019s Warblers flit restlessly between perches and make direct flights with rapid wingbeats through the understory. Unlike most warblers, they spend most of their time in the understory grabbing insects by hovering or by picking insects from foliage. Wilson\u2019s Warblers breed in mountain meadows and thickets near streams, especially those with willows and alders. They also breed along the edges of lakes, bogs, and aspen stands. Pacific Coast populations breed in shrubby habitat and in young stands of conifers, alders, or maples. During migration they use woodlands, suburban areas, desert scrub, and shrubby areas near streams. Western populations tend to be brighter yellow than Eastern populations. ",
    "183.Northern_Waterthrush": "A large but trim warbler with a short, fine bill, a rather short tail, and long legs. The bill is smaller than Louisiana Waterthrush\u2019s. Larger than a Yellow Warbler, smaller than an Eastern Bluebird. sparrow-sized or smaller. Both Sexes. Length: 4.7-5.5 in (12-14 cm). Weight: 0.5-0.7 oz (14.7-19.2 g). Wingspan: 8.9-10.0 in (22.5-25.5 cm). Brownish above, with a prominent pale eyebrow (supercilium); pale yellowish or buff below, with dark streaks. The legs are duskier and less pink than Louisiana Waterthrush. The supercilium stripe is thinner in Northern Waterthrush than in Louisiana, especially at rear, and is faintly yellowish. Northern Waterthrushes forage near or on the ground or in shallow water, where their long legs enable them to wade into pond edges in pursuit of prey. They sing mostly from low vegetation, often from a concealed perch. Northern Waterthrushes are almost always seen near still or stagnant water, even during migration. Wooded swamps, ponds with brushy edges, bogs, beaver ponds, and similar settings attract breeders and migrants, while wintering birds use mangroves.  The face of the Northern Waterthrush showcases a prominent white supercilium, which is a distinct white stripe that extends from the base of its bill and arches gracefully above its eye towards the back of its head. This trait is particularly useful in identification as it lends the bird an expressive appearance and helps to distinguish it from its close relative, the Louisiana Waterthrush. Furthermore, the Northern Waterthrush exhibits relatively large, round dark eyes that accentuate its alert and inquisitive demeanor.",
    "185.Bohemian_Waxwing": "Bohemian Waxwings are full-bellied, thick-necked birds with a shaggy crest atop a pin head. The wings are broad and pointed, like a starling's. The tail is fairly short and square-tipped. Larger than a bluebird, smaller than an American Robin. robin-sized. Both Sexes. Length: 6.3-7.5 in (16-19 cm). Weight: 1.6-2.4 oz (45-69 g). Wingspan: 13.0 in (33 cm). The Bohemian Waxwing is grayish brown overall with subtle peach blushing around its black mask. The wings have 2 distinctive white rectangular patches and red waxlike tips on the secondaries. The undertail is rusty and the tail is tipped in yellow. Juveniles are grayer overall with a streaked belly. Juveniles lack the adult's peach blushing around the face and the red-tipped secondaries. Bohemian Waxwings are social birds that form large, compact, and noisy groups-sometimes in the thousands- as they scour the landscape looking for fruit during the nonbreeding season. They dangle on flimsy branches to reach fruit or perch side by side in fruiting trees. Bohemian Waxwings breed in open evergreen forests and spend the nonbreeding season in open areas that have plentiful fruit, from city parks to forest patches near streams.  Starting from the top, the head of the Bohemian Waxwing showcases a striking cinnamon-brown crest, which adds a distinctive touch to its appearance. Beneath the crest, the bird's face is adorned with a black mask that extends across its eyes and gives it a slightly mysterious expression. The mask accentuates its piercing, yellow-rimmed dark eyes, which exude intelligence and a keen sense of curiosity.",
    "186.Cedar_Waxwing": "The Cedar Waxwing is a medium-sized, sleek bird with a large head, short neck, and short, wide bill. Waxwings have a crest that often lies flat and droops over the back of the head. The wings are broad and pointed, like a starling\u2019s. The tail is fairly short and square-tipped.

Cedar Waxwings are pale brown on the head and chest fading to soft gray on the wings. The belly is pale yellow, and the tail is gray with a bright yellow tip. The face has a narrow black mask neatly outlined in white. The red waxy tips to the wing feathers are not always easy to see. Cedar Waxwings are social birds that you\u2019re likely to see in flocks year-round. They sit in fruiting trees swallowing berries whole, or pluck them in mid-air with a brief fluttering hover. They also course over water for insects, flying like tubby, slightly clumsy swallows. Look for Cedar Waxwings in woodlands of all kinds, and at farms, orchards, and suburban gardens where there are fruiting trees or shrubs. ",

The underparts are white with fine blackish barring on the flanks. The face is black with a white line behind the eye and a thin white line below the cheek. The outer tail feathers are white, usually with a few black bars. Juveniles of both sexes have a small yellow crown patch. Forages by flaking or scaling bark from tree trunks, rarely excavating deeply into wood. Often spends long periods working on a single tree before moving on. Both sexes call and drum frequently in the spring and early summer. Disturbed forest such as young burned areas, bark beetle outbreaks, and windthrows in western and northern coniferous forests. Three subspecies are named: dorsalis in the Rocky Mountains, bacatus in the Great Lakes eastward, and fasciatus from Alaska and western Canada southward into Idaho and Oregon. These subspecies differ mostly in the plumage of the back. Eastern bacatus has a very dark back with narrow pale bars that can be difficult to see at a distance, Rocky Mountain dorsalis has a back that appears almost white, and the back of northwestern fasciatus varies from dark to whitish.

    "197.Marsh_Wren": "The Marsh Wren is a small, plump, round-bodied wren with a short tail that it often holds up almost vertically above its back. It has a thin bill and short wings. About the size of a House Wren, but smaller than a Song Sparrow. sparrow-sized or smaller. Both Sexes. Length: 3.9-5.5 in (10-14 cm). Weight: 0.3-0.5 oz (9-14 g). Wingspan: 5.9 in (15 cm). The Marsh Wren is a small, plump, round-bodied wren with a short tail that it often holds up almost vertically above its back. It has a thin bill and short wings. Marsh Wrens bounce around with their tails cocked in marshes filled with cattails and rushes. They grasp stalks of vegetation, legs splayed with each foot wrapped around a different stalk. Males occasionally pop up to sing from taller cattails. They rapidly beat their wings to make short flights within the marsh. Marsh Wrens occupy wetlands filled with cattails, sedges, bulrushes, and Phragmites as well as cordgrass-filled saltmarshes year-round. In the winter they also use brushy thickets near wetlands, tidal saltmarshes, and weedy agricultural canals. Multiple subspecies of Marsh Wrens occur throughout their range, and their taxonomy has yet to be fully evaluated. In general, individuals in the eastern United States are rustier and more brightly colored than individuals in the western U.S. Birds in the West also have a larger repertoire of songs that are harsher and more complex than those in the East (see Sounds). A small disjunct resident population also occurs in Mexico in the states of Hidalgo, Mexico, and Puebla. "
